Longer answer -- it's fine when other people identify you as an 'expert' in AutoCAD or Civil3d, but the reality is that there will always be gaps in your knowledge, regardless of how many hours over how many years you ut in with the software. So calling yourself an 'expert' is simply taunting Murphy, and inviting trouble when you least need it.

Very few can obtain expert status for AutoCad. Many are experts in their fields. Others are experts in particular facets of AutoCad. But to be an expert in the entire realm of AutoCad is coveted by few (
 
To achieve expert status in real world terms, you must be superior to your group. When most people in your office come to you to answer their AutoCad questions, then you are an AutoCad expert if you can give them reliable answers.

Oh, man! How true! I was at an ADSK event years ago and someone used "AutoCAD Expert" as their title on the name badge. That guy caught many, many rations of crap that week. Taunting Murphy is one thing, taunting a group of pretty high end ACAD users is entirely another.

The drawings are electrically drawings which are made with colors (mainly yellow) and the text is made with a so-called SHX Font. According to the AutoCad experts this mean that when I export the DWG to PDF with the AutoCad export tool I get properly scaled and black and white drawings but without searchable text since the text is made with an SHX Font.
 
By using Adobe Acrobat DC PRO and and by right clicking the DWG drawing in windows and using the convert to PDF function, I manage and convert the drawings to PDF. The drawings then contain searchable text, but the drawing is in color (mainly yellow) and not properly scaled (Stretched to fill an A4 sheet).
 
To convert the PDF into a Black & White document, you first need to go to Print Production. If it isn't showing on the right-hand edge, go to your More Tools and you'll find it there (2nd from right).
 
When you close this box you should be done for this. The one caveat is that the yellow lines and text might be a very light gray. I mean a very very light gray. The only way around that that I know of is to open each drawing up in Photoshop and make things darker there using Levels.
 
The architectural and design industry is continually advancing amid technological innovations. To remain relevant in the industry, businesses must constantly adapt to changing modern design techniques.
 
An AutoCAD drafter is a tech professional who uses AutoCAD to create designs for construction and engineering purposes. They use the software to design building plans, machinery, blueprints, and models for various construction purposes.
 
To be an AutoCAD drafter, an individual must be adept at using the AutoCAD software. A good drafter needs advanced knowledge of the software and its features to devise creative modeling and designing methods.
 
Advanced math and computer skills are necessary for drafters to operate specialized software and tackle projects. At the same time, they need solid knowledge of engineering and sciences to complement their skills and enable them to design with precision.
 
Experienced drafters often use multiple design software when creating a blueprint. A good AutoCAD drafter should have experience with similar design software like Inventor, SolidWorks, and Fusion 360 to develop more sophisticated designs.
 
AutoCAD drafters frequently interact with architects, engineers, and other clients. As such, they need excellent oral and written communication skills to convey ideas, express opinions, and present their designs.
 
Excellent drafters review blueprints to find errors or identify the need for adjustments. They must also be able to deliver adjustments timely to meet deadlines, and their designs must be functional to solve real problems.
 
AutoCAD experts should know how to manage multiple competing tasks and ensure that projects remain within safety guidelines and regulations. Consequently, their organizational skills are critical to maintaining team spirit and effectiveness.
 
The first step to hiring any professional is to evaluate the scope of your hiring process. You need to determine the organizational objectives you want your AutoCAD expert to achieve. These goals will vary from creating new product models to designing floor plans.
 
Next, you should identify the skills and knowledge requirements for the position. For an AutoCAD drafter position, you can focus on design-software skills, creative skills, and problem-solving abilities.
 
If your organization has a functional website or any other online platform with a large audience and traffic inflow, publish the job listing there. Alternatively, you can consider creative sourcing strategies to hire top talent.
 
Expert drafters constantly look for opportunities to grow in the field and related areas of expertise to build their portfolios and expand their knowledge scope. Having an employee with such drive is key to achieving organizational goals.
 
To improve the level of effectiveness in your organization, your employees need to maintain a certain standard of discipline and work ethic. You can hire drafters temporarily to determine these qualities.
 
AutoCAD drafters primarily work in an office where they design architectural plans and models for their company. Depending on the organization and industry, their work environment may change to semi-remote or fully remote.
