Though it was first published 60 years ago, Heller's scathing satire about the futility and absurdity of war continues to haunt and move listeners today. Set during World War II, the novel mostly concerns the actions of Captain John Yossarian and his comrades in the fictional 256th US Army Air Squadron. Heller explores many hefty themes, which, along with Heller's sharp, observant, and lyrical prose, make the book fertile ground for thought-provoking discussions and memorable quotes.

Below you'll find 30+ of the best quotes reflecting three of the book's central themes: power, faith, and death. Though there are certainly more worthy quotes in this incomparable listen, this collection cuts to the heart of the novel and will leave you thinking.
 
3. "Justice is a knee in the gut from the floor on the chin at night sneaky with a knife brought up down on the magazine of a battleship sandbagged underhanded in the dark without a word of warning."

6. "It was almost no trick at all, he saw, to turn vice into virtue and slander into truth, impotence into abstinence, arrogance into humility, plunder into philanthropy, thievery into honor, blasphemy into wisdom, brutality into patriotism, and sadism into justice. Anybody could do it; it required no brains at all. It merely required no character."
 
16. "So many things were testing his faith. There was the Bible, of course, but the Bible was a book, and so were Bleak House, Treasure Island, Ethan Frome and The Last of the Mohicans. Did it then seem probable, as he had once overheard Dunbar ask, that the answers to riddles of creation would be supplied by people too ignorant to understand the mechanics of rainfall?"
 
17. "Catch-22 did not exist, he was positive of that, but it made no difference. What did matter was that everyone thought it existed, and that was much worse, for there was no object or text to ridicule or refute, to accuse, criticize, attack, amend, hate, revile, spit at, rip to shreds, trample upon or burn up."
 
18. "What a lousy earth! He wondered how many people were destitute that same night even in his own prosperous country, how many homes were shanties, how many husbands were drunk and wives socked, and how many children were bullied, abused, or abandoned. How many families hungered for food they could not afford to buy? How many hearts were broken?"
 
21. "You're inches away from death every time you go on a mission. How much older can you be at your age? A half minute before that you were stepping into high school, and an unhooked brassiere was as close as you ever hoped to get to Paradise. Only a fifth of a second before that you were a small kid with a ten-week summer vacation that lasted a hundred thousand years and still ended too soon."
 
22. "History did not demand Yossarian's premature demise, justice could be satisfied without it, progress did not hinge upon it, victory did not depend on it. That men would die was a matter of necessity; which men would die, though, was a matter of circumstance, and Yossarian was willing to be the victim of anything but circumstance."
 
***Catch-22*** is a 1961 novel by Joseph Heller, an anti-war novel and a general critique of bureaucracy. The novel's title is from a catch, or snag, first described in the quote from chapter 5below. The phrase "catch-22" almost immediately entered common usage for that kind of conundrum or sense-defeating logic.
 
That ryhmes! In any event, in my previous post on Extra-sensory Perception, I allude to the psychological phenomenon of dj vu. But from Catch-22, I also learned about its accompanying jamais vu and presque vu. Here are two relevant quotes from Catch-22 that illusrate these concepts:
 
While many politicians are good, hard-working and intelligent people, others are not burdened by such traits. They can always be counted on for an amusing and silly quote or two. I wish I still had the notebook where I collected quotes. But I think I can remember a few.
 
I heard one guy lose his temper at a meeting once. The council kept complaining and chastising a member for engaging in something inappropriate. It was dragging on and on and everyone seemed to want to get on the record as being opposed to wrong-doing.
 
It really bothers me when someone describes an interesting coincidence as being "ironic." Being ironic is much more interesting that that. It is when the opposite of what would be expected happens -- preferably in some kind of interesting or poetic way.
 
I get the obvious error that the single quotes have escaped the sql code at in('123','456'), and if I wrap the sql code with double quotes, the sql is escaped where I create a new column "new\_column\_value" or when I select via literal string from the unhelpfully named "column.C".
 
While Heller created the phrase to satirize the circular logic of the military bureaucracy, the term has become part of everyday use for times when individuals feel trapped by the rules of bureaucratic systems. Just like Yossarian, people in the modern world face many baffling restrictions.
 
The idea of paradox recurs throughout the novel. The title itself refers to the paradox Yossarian is trapped within. Heller uses minor and major paradoxes to expose the contradictions and absurdity of Yossarian's environment. For example:
 
Many of the novel's paradoxes are used to display the illogical and humorous side of life in the military system and war in general. However, Heller also employs these paradoxes to satirize the bleak reality of war. While soldiers like Yossarian risk their lives to fly pointless missions, those in command can progress their careers or, in the case of Milo, increase their profits.
 
In 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower used his farewell address to warn about the dangers of America's ballooning military defense budget. He feared a private sector of arms manufacturers would monopolize public funds and threaten democracy. Eisenhower's concern was that the military-industrial complex would be more concerned with the profitability of war rather than the security of peace.
 
After the novel was published in 1961, America became increasingly involved in the fight against Communism in Vietnam. As the conflict escalated, America committed more troops, and the war became more deadly and unpopular.
 
The American counterculture of the 1960s was a popular youth movement that openly questioned societal norms surrounding race, class, and gender. With a firmly anti-establishment outlook, they protested the Vietnam War as an unjust conflict. As the anti-war movement grew through the decade, Catch-22 became especially popular and important to those who disagreed with the war. As well as finding many parallels with the book's depiction of needless conflict, they related to Yossarian's rebellion against the establishment.
 
Traditionally, a novel's protagonist is a classic hero; brave and unique, they fight for a greater good by doing the right thing. An **antihero** usually lacks these qualities but sometimes does the right thing for the wrong reason.
 
Heller uses humor to highlight the absurdity of military bureaucracy and question the need for war. The prose contains many humorous examples of paradox and dark humor, which is a literary device used by writers to address serious or taboo subjects in a light-hearted manner. Here are a few quotes from Catch-22.
 
His father named him Major Major Major as a joke. The army mistook his name for his ranking, so overnight, Private Major Major Major was promoted to Major Major Major Major. Knowing that he is entirely unfit for his office, the Major insists on booking appointments for times when he isn't in the office. In a classic example of the Catch-22 trap, it is impossible to ever actually see the Major.
 
Englishmen are dying for England, Americans are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia. There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war. Surely so many counties can't all be worth dying for." (Ch. 23)
 
While men fight and die on an industrial scale, they are reminded of their duty to defend the country. Only Yossarian notices that every side is motivated by the same cause. Heller uses humor and dry observations like this to question the ideals of nationalism and the wars fought in a country's name.
 
This is another example of the Catch-22 trap; according to the military command, it's fitting that Yossarian should fight and die for the ideals of freedom and independence, as long as he doesn't practice them!
 
I know that CRM 2011 has some "duplicate detection" features built in. But it looks like this only works for Contacts and Accounts. It lets you scan for duplicates on-demand, but furthermore it will warn you if you try to create a duplicate record, popping up a box saying "this record might be a duplicate."
 
We need the ability to extend this functionality to quotes and orders, specifically for the "Customer PO Number" field (a custom text field I created). To our salespeople, it's not an immediate red flag if a customer places another order with the same products as a previous order, since we do have regular/repeat customers who will order the same parts every so often.
 
What **is** a problem, though, is when they mistakenly submit the same order twice - as indicated by their purchase order number. We've had this happen twice in the past month, and didn't catch it until we were ready to actually fulfill the order and realized something seemed unusual.
 
Being a database designer, my initial thought was to make the "Customer PO Number" field a KEY field, that way SQL Server itself will ensure there are no duplicate val
