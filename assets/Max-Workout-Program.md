The best routine for the gym is one that is flexible with your schedule and you actually enjoy. These two factors will contribute greatly to your ability to be consistent with your workouts. Consistency with your workouts and progressing as you perform them is what will lead to results.

That being said, there are plenty of great workout program styles one can do to build muscle, lose fat, or build strength. The body composition goals (building muscle and losing fat) will be accomplished through similar style workouts combined with differing nutritional principles, while those looking for strength gains may need to focus on programs that are centered on the idea of specificity.
 
However, if you are looking to optimize your training by incorporating a higher training frequency (hitting each muscle group more often throughout the week), you may want to look into pairing certain muscle groups on certain workout days.
 
The best thing a beginner can do at the gym is seek out the help of a trained professional to assist them with learning the proper form of each exercise. Practicing the basics and establishing a solid foundation in terms of form will help a beginner lifter remain injury free throughout their life.
 
If you are not in the position to hire a trained professional, you may want to proceed working out with some level of caution. The same recommendation of practicing the fundamentals still applies. Start off with light weight (the bar on barbell exercises) and record yourself performing exercises.
 
The workouts should focus on learning ideal movement patterns of fundamental lifts such as horizontal presses, vertical presses, horizontal pulls, vertical pulls, squats, hip hinges, and loaded carries.

The following exercises are my personal favorite 10 exercises that would be fantastic to include in your workouts. However, like I said, you may need to substitute these with a variation that is better suited for your individual body type, training experience, and needs.
 
Exercise selection for a good gym routine will train fundamental movement patterns (push, pull, lunge, hip hinge, squat, and carry) in a way that you are comfortable performing them. There is a pain-free variation for nearly every body type who can healthily perform these movements.
 
The total amount of weight someone should use is going to be different from individual to individual, and also exercise to exercise for each individual. Depending on the program, it might vary from set to set of each exercise based on the rep scheme.
 
Cardio recommendations will be highly dependent on your overall goal. For most, it may not be even necessary to perform additional cardio. Focusing on progressing the weight used in your workouts and getting stronger over time will have a more beneficial impact on your body composition than cardio will.
 
For those looking to lose body fat, focus should be primarily on your diet. Once you plateau, you can then add in additional cardio as a means to increase your progress. Again, it might not even be necessary.
 
By being consistent with their training, focusing on hitting each muscle group at least 2 times a week with an appropriate volume and weight for their abilities, and by progressing the weight used from workout to workout whenever possible.
 
Generally, to see progress 2-4 workouts are needed. 3-4 workouts per week is the sweet spot. You can train more frequently depending on your goals and experience level. However, at least 2 days of resistance training per week is needed to see muscle growth.
 
With that being said, during your training days, it is beneficial to perform full body workouts (2-3 training days per week) or upper/lower workouts (4 days per week). This will allow you to train with an optimal frequency to build or maintain lean body mass.
 
There are certainly supplements than can help you with the nutrition portion of things. Protein shakes are beneficial if you have trouble meeting your daily protein requirements. Mass gainer shakes are beneficial is you have trouble meeting your daily calorie requirements. Creatine can help improve performance and can help you build muscle more efficiently if you struggle to get it through your diet as well. And, of course, water is the driver of all things.
 
Find a good 3-5 day per week weight training program that is well thought out with an appropriate volume and split and stick to it. Instead of chasing workouts, chase progressions. Try to improve your lifts in some way. This is going to help you out a lot more in the long run.
 
Remember, nutrition is more important that your workout routine. You can have the best plan in the world and if you don't back it up with the fuel you need for your goal you will not succeed. Use our BMR calculator to calculate your calories then choose the right diet plan for you and get some healthy recipes to keep things interesting.

In general, most beginners have been lifting for less than a year, intermediates for at least 1 year, and advanced trainees for at least 2 years. Keep in mind that you should not attempt advanced workouts unless you have appropriate strength training experience.
 
This workout routine has you in the gym 3 days per week (such as Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), with full-body sessions completed each day. This allows you to get used to new movements, focus on proper form, and take time to recover.
 
If you do it correctly, you can follow this routine for several years until you reach an advanced level. It may be helpful to switch up your exercises on occasion to keep yourself engaged and prevent burnout.
 
This grueling workout routine has you in the gym 6 days per week with 1 rest day in between. It follows a pull-push-legs pattern, hitting each muscle group twice per week, with supersets incorporated for maximum hypertrophy (muscle growth).
 
Trainees over age 40 may have to adjust their workout routine to account for injuries or slower recovery times. While muscle and bone mass decline as you age, you can combat this with proper exercise.
 
Nutrient timing, which involves eating at specific times to yield results, may also be vital to maximize muscle gains. For example, many experts recommend eating a well-balanced meal or snack within 2 hours of a workout, ideally both before and after (5, 6).
 
For instance, if strength is your goal (your power against resistance), the National Sports and Conditioning Association recommends 3 or more sets of up to 6 reps. You should lift heavier loads if strength is your goal (7, 8).

The amount of exercise you need varies depending on your fitness level and goals. However, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the World Health Organization recommend healthy adults ages 18 to 64 aim for the following weekly goals:
 
For adults over 65 years old, exercises that improve balance can help prevent falls. Meanwhile, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends stretching major muscle groups, such as those in the arms and back, at least two or three times a week to help maintain flexibility.
 
Imagine your weekly fitness routine is like one of those magnetic puzzle sets you can easily snap together with a variety of different colored geometric shapes. Each color symbolizes a different kind of workout, allowing you to create your own, unique pattern.
 
An example of a simple schedule may be cardio on Mondays and Thursdays, strength training on Tuesdays and Fridays and balance and flexibility on Wednesdays and Saturdays, plus active rest (walking or stretching) on Sundays.
 
Petreycik recommends completing two to four sets of eight to 25 repetitions per exercise. The weight you choose and the number of reps depends on your goal, but you should always be able to maintain proper form, he adds. To increase muscle size and strength, he suggests aiming to max out around six to eight reps. For muscle endurance, aim for 12 to 25 reps.
 
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts feature repeated short bursts of intense activity that alternate between periods of maximum effort and low-intensity exercise or rest. As lack of time can be an obstacle when trying to develop an exercise routine, HIIT workouts can help people stay more engaged and support fitness goals with less of a time commitment, according to research.
 
See my recommendations in italics to help you achieve similar exercises at home without equipment. If the sets or reps listed below are too difficult, honor your current strength level and work your way up over time.
 
Your body is the final arbiter and best possible judge of the workouts and fitness schedule that work best for you. To create a workout plan that lasts, the
