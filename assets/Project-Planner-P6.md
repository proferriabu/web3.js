It now has room for over 100 projects, each broken down into concise task lists and monthly timelines. The open-dated yearly, monthly and weekly sections encourage you to set goals and see them through, and a new notes section provides space to jot down ideas and to-dos. Smyth Sewn binding lies flat when open and a durable, fabric-like cover with an elastic band holds it all together.

Is this a solo project or a team project?  If it's just you, use the personal task management app, To Do. You can also see tasks from To Do in the Tasks app in Teams, and in Outlook Tasks. Project and Planner are built for team projects.

Are there few deliverables and dependencies, or many?  For a simpler team project, we recommend using Planner. If you need to track dependencies, costs, or more complexity, Project works best. You can use Project desktop or Project for the web. You can see your Planner tasks, both individual and team, in the Tasks app in Teams, and you also see your Project for the web projects in Teams using the Project app in Teams.
 
Project for the web is a cloud-based project management app that allows you to easily create and collaborate on projects, whether or not you're a project manager. You can use three views for multiple planning options: Grid for data, Board for Kanban-style planning, and Timeline for a Gantt view to show which tasks depend on each other.
 
The Project desktop application can be great for creating a schedule where you want to organize work into phases, have dependencies between tasks, and so on, either for oneself or for publishing to a team.
 
Project Online is a web-based application that can work for small, medium, and large businesses. Project managers can create schedules and assign tasks to resources who can then see their tasks and report time. Portfolio managers can look across all projects to see what people are working on.
 
The Tasks app in Microsoft Teams brings together your individual tasks from To Do and Outlook with your team tasks from Planner so you can more efficiently cross them off your lists. Use the unique List view to change many tasks at once, and easily find and edit them. Use the Tasks app to work on To Do and Planner tasks alongside the Teams channels, chats, and apps you're used to.
