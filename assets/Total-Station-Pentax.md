For the older model Pentax total stations, Western Latitudes, appears to be the only factory authorized Pentax repair facility in the USA. They have headquarters in Centennial, Colorado and a Pentax repair facility in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
 
An estimate at Western Latitude is $205 per unit. Repair work is $120 per hour. As an example, my Pentax-325N was damaged during shipment to a meet in Oregon. It needed 3 hours of work: needs alignment; align EDM; complete calibration. Another unit, a Pentax PCS 215, was also damaged during shipment to a meet in Oregon, required 10 hours of labor: needs alignment; disassemble telescope; tighten and adjust EDM prisms; reassemble; adjust EDM; complete calibration.
 
Total Station W-823NX is the most powerful instrument of a series of construction total stations Pentax W-823NX. Total station has excellent angle accuracy (3")

The use of Windows CE. NET makes it possible to replace application software and access the Internet using a communication modem card. High resolution (VGA) LCD display provides highly clear graphic display close to that of a PC, making the W-800 series a new generation total station. Both total station and data collector need to be brought to the survey site and by operating the both instruments, survey data are taken, stored and processed. The W-800 series can do all that alone. The storage and transfer of large-size data and flexible data communication are possible with the availability of 4 kinds of standard interface, i.e. R-232C, USB, CF Card slot and SD card slot.
