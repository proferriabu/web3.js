They can be very picky with what they eat, and their inherent bounciness makes it easy for them to escape if you don't prep properly.
 
The reason you're ranching slimes is for Plorts, valuable byproducts that slimes produce periodically. Different slimes produce different Plorts which have varying values, but you don't have to sacrifice all your space to each type of slime. You can instead combine them into Largo slimes that are able to produce multiple types of Plorts at once.

Alongside the basic Slimes that you can find out in the field, you can also encounter Largo Slimes. These are a combination of multiple slime types, appearing larger and having physical distinctions based on their types. In addition to being able to produce two types of plorts at once, they also adopt the behaviors of their source slimes allowing you to adjust their diets. You can make a largo simply by feeding a slime a plort different from its own. Here are the best options.
 
The Glass Desert is an interesting location to visit, and you're guaranteed to encounter Tangle and Dervish Slimes while you're there. Since they're both docile, it's quite easy to capture them and take them back to the ranch where you can turn them into a valuable Largo.
 
Their plorts are relatively valuable being worth 75 Newbucks each. In terms of characteristics, Tangles are meat-eaters while Dervishes are fruit-eaters, so turning them into a Largo will allow you to focus entirely on a fruit-based diet, specifically Prickle Pears.
 
Of all the areas you'll get to explore in Slime Rancher, the Moss Blanket is where you'll spend much of your time. It's one of the first areas you'll get access to, and it's quite calm and full of a variety of slimes. This includes the sweet Honey Slime and the intimidating-sounding Hunter Slime.
 
Since they're both docile and encountered early on, this is a Largo you can start making to get some quick plorts valued at 45 and 60 Newbucks. This will also allow you to make their diet fruit-based with their favorite food being Mint Mango.
 
There are a bunch of different Slimes that vastly differ in power and action, so it's best to be cautious around the more unusual ones. This applies to the spiky Crystal Slimes that can be found in the Indigo Quarry and the mysterious Quantum Slimes found in the Glass Desert and Ancient Ruins.

Though the Crystal Slime is harmful and Quantum Slimes can be difficult to manage, it's worth turning them into a Largo. Though their plorts have a good value of 60 Newbucks each, these slimes' combined weakness to water makes their hazards much easier to manage. They have an easy diet of both veggies and fruits.
 
You don't need to be a scientist to know that you shouldn't mix explosives, but that's a different story in Slime Rancher. The two Slimes of Rad and Boom have some very volatile qualities which you can encounter in various areas, but both can spawn in the Indigo Quarry and Wilds.
 
They're both harmful in terms of exploding and giving off radiation, but combining them can make them easier to keep in check. Their plorts share a value of 45 Newbucks, their Largo can subsist on veggies, and both of their harmful energies can be suppressed with water.
 
If Slime Rancher has a mascot, it's the Pink Slime. These happy blobs can be found all over alongside the grumpier Rock Slimes as distinguished by their spikes. Since these slimes can be found early on, it makes sense to combine them into a Largo to get a quick boost in plorts and Newbucks.
 
Though the Pink Slimes are quite friendly, they're not the only happy and harmless slimes you can encounter. The playful Tabby Slime which can be found all over and the night-only glowing Phosphor Slime are both cheerful in appearance and make for good Largo partners.
 
It's another combo that makes for a more manageable fruit-based diet with a favorite in Cuberries. Though their plorts are both worth 22 Newbucks each, the value of this combo is that it can be farmed early on for easy money.
 
Though the world of Slime Rancher may seem bright and colorful, there is also an element of danger that can be found in harmful and feral Slimes. The fiery Mosaic Slime and the aggressive Saber Slime are examples of such dangers lurking in areas like the Glass Desert and the Wilds respectively.
 
You should combine these two into a Largo slime to get plorts with values of 60 and 75 Newbucks. It also makes it so that the combo will have a favorite food in Silver Parsnips to keep them happy while water can be used to keep their fiery light in check.
 
A **Largo** is a fusion of two slimes. It is formed by a slime that eats a plort unlike the ones it produces. Once in this form, it will carry over several factors, including: diet, favorite food, risks, slimeology, and plort production. By mixing Slimepedia entries together one can discover the needs of a largo. Largos will produce one of each plort of the slimes they are fused with; e.g, a Rock Tabby Largo will produce a Rock and Tabby Plort after eating. Trying to fuse an already existing largo with another slime plort will cause a Tarr to spawn. By mixing slime types various combinations can be discovered.
 
By feeding a largo a favorite food of one of it's components, 2 of each plort will be made. For example, feeding a Rock Tabby Largo either a Stony Chicken or a Heart Beet will produce 2 Rock Plorts and 2 Tabby Plorts
 
It is suggested to use the High Walls upgrade for the Corral, or else the Largos may escape via jumping, as they can jump higher than regular Slimes. An Auto Feeder and Plort Collector should also be used if the Largo either was a Rock Slime before, or ate a Rock Plort, otherwise they may hurt the rancher by accident.
 
Pretty much devours anything and everything food wise, detrimental if one is running free of a Corral on farm with more valuable food. Usually I am feeding them excessive amounts of Carrots from Odd Onion Gardens but having feed it a few of the foods around the game will net you:
 
Playful creatures in that when crossbred and by themselves they will play with food. This can be wasteful if using the Auto-Feeder feature of a corral. Stony Hens can be obtained along the way to the Moss Blanket door. Typically found on top of the center of area before turning right towards the dock ways. Also an achievement if you stand still and let it jump into your face:
 
Easy to spot before they random roll around doing damage if you happen to be in their path. And they dislike space invaders if your trying to wade into the thick of them in the wild or a corral with several of them. Mixing these guys with other Aggressive types are not recommended as they will bring the dangers to you. Heart beats can be found real early either a crate or from their hidden grow spot in the first area from your Ranch. Just jump over the short wall near the Pogofruit tree on the ground to the left. Their plorts combined with favorite vegetable means you can obtain:
 
These guys only really come out at night as well as the Feral Largo's along the docks towards Moss Blanket. Some Ferals also can be found in the cave towards Indigo. Unless your in the Grotto at your Ranch or your corral has the Solar Shield upgrade any Phosphor/Largo Combo's will be lost. Also any corrals will have to have the Air Net upgrade to contain Phosphor/Largo Combo's as the High Wall will not cut it. I have found the Grotto can contain them fairly well if they escape and despite having Tarr-crows on Gardens they can still grab the food as they tend to fall into the gardens eat then react to Tarr-crows. Cuberry can be found via crates or on the path towards Moss Blanket. Both come from trees on rock faces on far side of where you find Stony Hens nest and on a branch at a turn when Ferals typically appear.
 
A curious slime that, thou has a dangerous and obvious field of effect, is not directly aggressive. Oca Oca however will be found around the Indigo area. Largo combination with a Rad will still instill its AOE and on aggressive slimes and a few passive makes for keeping a good distance... An achievement can be netted by standing in a field for 15 seconds:
 
Found both in Moss and Indigo areas they are unpredictable unless you can catch the crackles on their body starting to reach the top of their heads before they explode and knock things about that they were near, even out of a closed in corral. Water can help to slow their explosive nature, Music Box helps to slow their explosions as well. Hungry Boom slimes will explode more often as well as agitated Boom slimes. Launching a boom Largo into the air as he starts to explode will net you the achievement:
 
These guys are found in Moss Blanket and stand out quite easily in the green hued environment. Usually leaping from various flower like foliage you can net them without to much difficulty. The Mint Mango, also found near Honey Slime spawns, are a little harder to come by due to how few fruit and how large the number of Honey and Pink slimes are in the area. If you can find a crate or one on the ground, sacrifice anything to grab it.
 
Included into this list for the sake of a complete slime list. These guys can be encountered at the first lake in Moss Blanket and several other water bodies through out the zone. You can also find a few in Indigo but Moss will have a larger population through out with the Jet Pack. Either kept in the Pond or in the Docks (5000) built in water pool with rubber ducky, you can still keep them but you need to water them often outside the water pools. They have no special needs other than water and will a
