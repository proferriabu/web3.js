While preserving the basic narrative of the *Iliad*, this selection also highlights the epic's high poetic moments and essential mythological content, and will prove especially useful in surveys of world literature.
 
Situated near the southern tip of the Kenai Peninsula, Homer is often described as "where the land ends and the sea begins," "the cosmic hamlet by the sea," an arts community, and a fishing community. Regardless of the depiction, it is universally recognized that Homer occupies one of the most breathtaking locations worldwide, offering awe-inspiring vistas of Kachemak Bay, the Kenai Mountains, and several volcanic peaks across Cook Inlet, including Mt. Augustine, Mt. Iliamna, and Mt. Redoubt.
 
Homer is renowned for the Homer Spit, a natural 4.5-mile land formation jutting into Kachemak Bay. This spit accommodates the town's port facilities, small boat harbor, numerous shops, restaurants, the Nick Dudiak "Fishing Hole," campgrounds, charter fishing, sightseeing businesses, and other attractions. During the summer months, the Spit teems with activity, functioning as a focal point for commercial fishing, an essential pillar of the local economy. Homer proudly claims the title of "Halibut Capital of the World," as it lands more halibut than any other port globally.
 
While fishing and tourism play significant roles in Homer's economy, the town's foundation extends beyond these sectors. Marine trades form a noteworthy industry cluster, and the Alaska Department of Labor recognizes entrepreneurship as a crucial component of Homer's economic equation. Education and health services are vital contributors to the local economy and enhance the overall quality of life in Homer. The town has become increasingly popular as a retirement destination and a locale for summer homes. Those who have the freedom to choose their place of residence are drawn to Homer by its natural beauty, cultural and recreational opportunities, and the warm and welcoming nature of its residents.

Homer residents enthusiastically embrace the abundant outdoor recreational activities available, such as fishing, hiking, skiing, kayaking, snow-machining, birding, and kite-surfing, among others. In addition to these attractions, Homer boasts the finest arts scene and restaurants of any small town in Alaska, earning well-deserved recognition. Many of these establishments can be found on Pioneer Avenue or in "Old Town," as well as along the Spit. The Pratt Museum and the Alaska Islands and Ocean Visitor Center are two prominent attractions in Homer. The Islands and Ocean Center serves as the headquarters for the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge and the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. For comprehensive information on local events, opportunities, and services, the Homer Chamber of Commerce operates a visitor information center. Furthermore, Homer is home to a plethora of non-profit organizations that enrich the community and offer diverse volunteer prospects.
 
Homer prides itself on its ambitious and forward-thinking nature, embracing responsible economic development. The town's major goals for the coming decade encompass the addition of further large vessel harbor space and the establishment of a haul-out repair facility at the Port and Harbor.

Homer has also garnered recognition for its commitment to sustainability. As the first community in Alaska to adopt a Climate Action Plan in 2007, the City of Homer has since followed up with an employee sustainability guidebook and a program dedicated to improving energy efficiency and conservation in all City buildings and facilities.
 
Like the men whose epic stories Jon Krakauer has told in his previous bestsellers, Pat Tillman was an irrepressible individualist and iconoclast. In May 2002, Tillman walked away from his $3.6 million NFL contract to enlist in the United States Army. He was deeply troubled by 9/11, and he felt a strong moral obligation to join the fight against al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Two years later, he died on a desolate hillside in southeastern Afghanistan.

This weekend, Americans are standing in line, grabbeing a tub of buttery popcorn, sitting down in the dark and awaiting The Word. And from a dozen Dolby-sound speakers it will thunder forth: "D'OH!" Twenty years after "The Simpsons" first appeared as quickie cartoon shorts on "The Tracey Ullman Show" and roughly 18 years after getting their own series on Fox, Springfield's first family is starring in a big-screen movie.

Microgrids can improve resilience, decarbonization and affordability of the electric grid, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. However, legacy state energy policies remain a barrier to timely development. In collaboration with the research group Wood Mackenzie, the industry trade group Think Microgrid has developed a road map for new approaches designed to promote microgrid commercialization across the United States.
 
Despite the backdrop of a promising global surge in renewable energy deployment, the United States (U.S.) is struggling to implement a paradigm-shifting energy transition in the context of an aging electric infrastructure. Most of the electric grid in the U.S. dates from the 1960s and 1970s; 70% of the transmission lines are more than 25 years old and 90% of the transformers exceed 40 years in age. The U.S. has experienced 70% more power outages since 2010 than during previous decades, partially due to failures in an aging grid and partially because of increasingly frequent extreme weather events.
