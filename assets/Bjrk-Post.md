On Wednesday evening I slid into the opening of Bjork\u2019s Cornucopia in Los Angeles, her newish show based on her 2017 album Utopia with Arca. Afterwards, my friend Matt Dell and I headed to a dingy Carl\u2019s Junior and wrote this late-night report together over kundle-laced jalapeno poppers. Matt used to throw DIY shows in Los Angeles and now works in weed; I\u2019m tickled to have him as Rave New World\u2019s first guest writer.

Below, we discuss the post-apocalyptic politics of Bjork\u2019s fairycore aesthetics, her trans-humanist vision of the future, and the cringey Greta Thunberg coda. Did you catch the show? Let us know what you think in the comments or Discord. (PS: so cute to meet some Discord folks at my ambient birthday rave last weekend! Thanks for the cookies.)
 
Our techno-pagan queen has descended from the ethereal plane to LA this week to stage her sumptuous spectacle Cornucopia. After a brief hassle with security rifling through our bags and discarding Matt\u2019s precious vape, we found our primo seats in the orchestra pit (thanks PR plugs!). Former masonic temple The Shrine\u2019s stained glass tableaus, soaring onion domes, and arabesque embellishments transported us to a realm far from the neighborhood\u2019s USC frat houses and fast-food chains.
 
The crowd was an amusing mix of queer club stans dressed for a rave, older Boomer heads, and a scattering of normie couples. A monotone announcement rang over the auditorium that no photography or video would be permitted during the performance, repeated three times to the room\u2019s applause.
 
The first act of Cornucopia was one of the most sumptuous spectacles we\u2019ve ever seen. Hyperreal projections of flowers and bulbous organic materials projected on a delicate fringe curtain that hung like undulating spaghetti, slowly peeling back to reveal Bjork in her biophiliac cosmos. Her look was giving Mothball Fantasy\u2014a dress by designer Noir Kei Ninomiya of giant white poofs over a green spandex suit, a mask that recalled scarab wings, white platform boots.
 
Bjork is the OG of the fairycore aesthetic now trending on Pinterest, a visual style couched in fantasy and escapism. Bjork\u2019s transhumanism has a more political angle, designed to break the binary of artificial and real. \u201CThe words nature and techno mean the same thing,\u201D she once posted. \u201CDepends on whether you\u2019re looking from the past or future.\u201D

Revolving vulva-like visuals on the dark gray stage scrim evoked a petri dish of microorganisms\u2014a reminder of the ecstatic beauty of invisible worlds we cannot see. Meanwhile, Bjork\u2019s tender vocals crooned \u201CI care for you, care for you\u201D on opener \u201CThe Gate\u201D as a circle of flute-playing fairies surrounded her. Maybe unconditional affection is an antidote to the bleak blackpill of this \u201Cpost\u201D-pandemic reality; it certainly felt like balm. In an interview, Bjork described Utopia as being about \u201Csurviving after the pollution,\u201D noting: \u201CIt's not post-apocalyptic. I would say it's post-ecstatic.\u201D
 
Note: Our week of Guest DJs continues with Bjrk. The Icelandic singer recently announced she'll be releasing a new album, possibly before the end of the year. In this 2009 conversation with All Songs Considered host Bob Boilen, Bjrk talked about Voltac, her box set of live recordings, her love of Syrian musician Omar Souleyman, fellow Icelandic singer lf Arnalds and more.
 
Icelandic singer Bjrk chats with All Songs Considered host Bob Boilen about some of her favorite artists and spins an eclectic mix of music. Hear selections from Syrian musician Omar Souleyman, the post punk duo Eyeless in Gaza, fellow Icelandic singer Olof Arnalds, The Pokrovsky Ensemble and the wildly eccentric, London-based rock group Micachu and the Shapes. Bjork's latest album is 'Voltaic,' a collection of live-to-tape studio performances of songs from some of her past albums, including 'Medulla,' 'Post,' and 'Vespertine.' You can hear the entire album online as part of our Exclusive First Listen series.
 
The name Bjrk conjures some well-worn images. She's the otherworldly artist whose album rollouts resemble large-scale art projects. She's the avant-garde fashion maven who smiled serenely in the "swan dress" at the 2001 Oscars. And yes, she's the eternal kook selling a box set of 14 handmade bird-call flutes to complement her 2017 album, *Utopia*.
 
Born Bjrk Gumundsdttir, the singer moved from her native Iceland to London in the early '90s. Single in the big city with a young son, Sindri, the musician was eager for new experiences. London's sound clash of electronic music promised endless possibilities.
 
Gradually, Bjrk met her people. She found kindred spirits in Graham Massey, founding member of Manchester acid house innovators 808 State, and Nellee Hooper, a sound system veteran known for his work with Soul II Soul. Out of this creative awakening came Bjrk's *Debut*, in 1993, and its astonishing follow-up, *Post*, which turned 25 this June.
 
In her formative years, Bjrk played in rock bands, but she was never a rock loyalist. Growing up in the Icelandic capital of Reykjavk, she learned the country's folk songs from her grandmother. After her parents divorced early in her life, Bjrk moved between the domains of her straight-laced electrician father and free-spirited activist mother.
 
In spite of splitting her time between parents, she was always surrounded by music. Her mother couldn't afford an oboe, so Bjrk learned the flute instead. On the long walks to and from school, she honed her remarkable singing voice. She released an album at 11 years old and found success in the Icelandic alt-rock group, The Sugarcubes. (Her former husband and father to her son, Sindri, was the band's guitarist.)
 
Bjrk also found a creative groove with Nellee Hooper, a former member of the Bristol DJ collective The Wild Bunch turned GRAMMY-winning superproducer for the likes of U2, Sinead O'Connor and Gwen Stefani, among others. Bjrk and Hooper shared a vision for a complete concept, which would later become her aptly titled 1993 debut album, *Debut*. (The Massey-assisted "Army Of Me" and "The Modern Things" were shelved for later use.) Produced by Bjrk and Hooper alone, *Debut* cleanly broke ties with the singer's rock past and instead welcomed trip-hop, house and synth-pop into her sound.
 
In the afterglow of *Debut*, Bjrk went deeper into London club culture. She wanted her next album to reflect the restless pulse and possibilities of her newly adopted home. "Most acts were putting out seven-inches with throwaway lyrics like, 'Ooh, baby, baby,'" Massey told Paper Magazine in 1997. "But Bjrk took that culture and made an album with poetic lyrics. It blew everyone away. She never tried to fit in with any electronic movement, she just took the ideas and got personal with it."
 
That "poetic" album was *Post*. On its cover, Bjrk looks out from a heightened Piccadilly Circus in London's West End. Her jacket, designed by art world favorite Hussein Chalayan, resembles a U.K. Airmail envelope. (Bjrk, a frequent shopper at London's acid-house-inspired fashion store Sign Of The Times, already had designer cred.)
 
On nights out, Bjrk had got to know Hooper's friends, including Massive Attack collaborator Tricky and Scottish producer Howie B. With input from her nocturnal cohort, Bjrk was determined to make *Post* much more riotous than *Debut*.
 
Bjrk left the hustle of London to begin work on *Post* at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. The stories from those sessions are pure, uncut Bjrk excess. She used extra-long leads on her microphone and headphones to record at the ocean's edge. She sang "Cover Me" in a cave full of bats. On a side trip to Iceland, she swam in hot springs and admired glaciers with Tricky. (The pair briefly dated, but as Tricky put it bluntly to self-titled years later, "I wasn't a good boyfriend.")
 
Back in London, Bjrk continued to hone *Post*, reaching for a balance between organic sounds and machine-made elements. In the final stretch, she coaxed Brazilian composer Eumir Deodato from semi-retirement to help fill out the sound. At last, *Post* was ready for the world.
 
Albums often open with something moody and instrumental to set the tone. *Post* is not that kind of album. From the first moment, "Army Of Me" is all crunching propulsion, its shoulder-shaking lyrics sparked by Bjrk's sometimes-wayward younger brother. ("It's sort of a 'big sister telling little brother off' song," she told Stereogum in 2008.)
 
From the jump, *Post* refuses to sit still. No two tracks can be easily grouped. "Hyperballad" is somehow a few songs in one five-minute package: equal parts acid house and Deodato's swelling strings, with a virtuoso vocal performance that combines innocent wonder and furious catharsis.
 
All these years later, "It's Oh So Quiet" remains an uninhibited thrill. While reverent to the 1951 version by Betty Hutton, itself a powerhouse, the song's ecstatic Bjrk-ness cuts through the throwback big-band sound, building from a whisper to gale-force theatrics.
 
On "Isobel," written with Icelandic poet Sjn, Bjrk reached for, as she later told Stereogum, a "heightened mythical state." The song sounds like scaling a glacier and singing to the stars. But *Post* never lets you pin Bjrk as an ethereal, unknowable pixie. She also does "normal people" things, like getting too drunk and staying out until sunrise. (Hungover Bjrk interviews were a theme of the mid-'90s. "I come from a country where from the age of 15 you drink one liter of vodka every Friday straight from the bottle," she told SPIN in 1997.)
 
She also knows a messy breakup as well as anyone. So from the astral plane of "Isobel" we go to
