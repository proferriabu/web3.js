This document provides an overview of all parts of the ISO/IEC 15408 series. It describes the various parts of the ISO/IEC 15408 series; defines the terms and abbreviations to be used in all parts of the standard; establishes the core concept of a Target of Evaluation (TOE); describes the evaluation context and describes the audience to which the evaluation criteria is addressed. An introduction to the basic security concepts necessary for evaluation of IT products is given.

International hacking scandals are putting the spotlight on countries' security loopholes and weaknesses. With many governments calling for higher security, their requirements for secure IT products are increasingly stringent.
 
UL Solutions was one of the first laboratories involved in the European Common Approval Scheme for Point-Of-Interaction devices. Today, UL Solutions is an accredited Common Criteria IT Security Evaluation Facility - providing advisory and evaluation services to help IT vendors successfully complete security evaluations.
 
Formalized as ISO/IEC 15408, the Common Criteria (CC) defines a hierarchical framework of security concepts and terminology. The CC also defines the Protection Profile (PP) construct which is a product category-specific but product-agnostic requirements template. This allows prospective consumers, developers and regulatory groups to create standardized sets of security threats, objectives, requirements and assurance measures. The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is that part of the product or system which is subject to evaluation. The Security Target (ST) contains the product-specific instantiation of the standardized content from the PP along with a summary specification of how the TOE satisfies the Security Functional Requirements and is used by the evaluators as the basis for evaluation. The Common Criteria Recognition Agreement (CCRA) forms an international cooperative agreement whereby participating government organizations ensure Certification Bodies issuing CC Certificates meet high and consistent standards as well as the conditions for mutual recognition.
 
UL Solutions provides consulting and evaluation services to help IT vendors successfully complete security evaluations.

In the US the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) releases policies binding upon all U.S. Government departments and agencies. Policy 11 requires all Information Assurance (IA) and IAEnabled IT products to be selected from the NIAP Product Compliant List (PCL). IA and IA-enabled products are those that have any mechanism providing for the availability of systems, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of information, or ensuring the authentication and non-repudiation of parties in electronic transactions. This requirement is also stated in the NIAP FAQ. It is worth noting that this is not always understood or fully enforced by contractors, integrators, procurement, etc. For example, the need to be on the NIAP PCL vs just having a Common Criteria certificate from any CC country/scheme.
 
UL Solutions validation includes assistance with Security Target authoring to ensure your evaluation gets started right. UL Solutions also has a strong entropy assessment team and can provide full entropy analysis. UL Solutions is a FIPS 140 certified test lab and can provide NIST CAVP algorithm certification required by NIAP.
 
UL Solutions begins an evaluation with an extensive workshop to review the PP requirements and the Target of Evaluation (TOE) design which helps highlight compliance concerns and kick-start the ST documentation authoring. The evaluation process requires 100% compliance with the requirements of the Protection Profile and as a result ends up being an iterative process.
 
After all documentation has been evaluated and is largely conformant, UL Solutions will take delivery of the product and perform functional testing. This testing is typically done at UL Solutions facilities and may leverage some vendor-specific testing tools, depending on the testing required. This is a collaborative process, where UL Solutions may reach out to the vendor to address functional issues, typically related to the configuration of the product. Once all tests are passing the testing is complete and the project can move to the last phase.
 
The final phase requires all findings of the project to be submitted to NIAP in a specific form known as the Evaluation Technical Report. This will include a brief summary of activities of the evaluation known as the Assurance Activity Report. UL Solutions responds to the Evaluation Coordination Review with NIAP. Upon formal validation, the ST, AAR, and the Validation report will become public record and posted on the NIAP website with the Validation certificate.
 
Founded in 1894, UL Solutions has been a leader in product testing and certification for over 100 years. As such, UL Solutions has the ability not only to conduct Common Criteria certification under multiple schemes, but to evaluate products to multiple cyber-security, safety and performance standards in parallel with Common Criteria certification.
 
The short answer is yes, BIG-IP 14.1.4.4 does comply with ICSA and Common Criteria (ISO/IEC 15480) standards, but that combination of device model and BIG-IP version has not been officially certified.
 
BIG-IP 14.1.2 and 14.1.4.2 have both been certified on a number of F5 devices, on VE, and on vCMP against the Common Criteria Network Device collaborative Protection Profile and the Stateful Traffic Filter Firewall Protection Profile Module. See for details and links to the certificates, and for other certified releases. While the i2000 is not part of the certification, the version of BIG-IP that runs on the i2000 is the same as that which runs on the other iSeries devices.
 
ISO/IEC 15408 is essentially the ISO description of Common Criteria, and as such, we meet the compliance requirements of the NDcPP and Firewall PPM. GB/T is the Chinese version of Common Criteria, and I can't say that we meet every standard as described in that document, since we have not certified against it.
 
The main aim of ISO/IEC 15408 or Common Criteria is to provide a standard set of requirements for the security functionality of IT products and for assurance measures applied to these products during a security evaluation. It allows vendors to have their products independently evaluated and certified against recognized security standards, and it provides purchasers with a metric to determine the security properties of IT products.
 
ISO/IEC 15408 applies to IT industries and any other sector that relies on IT products and wants to ensure that those products meet specific security criteria. This includes, but isn't limited to, sectors such as government, defense, healthcare, finance, and telecommunications.
 
Evaluations against the Common Criteria are conducted in licensed evaluation facilities, leading to the granting of a security certification by the certifying body of a participating country. The frequency of evaluations will often be driven by changes to the product, the need to achieve a higher Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL), or the expiration of an existing certification.
 
ISO/IEC 27702 refers to a code of practice for information security management and is a common basis and practical guideline for developing enterprise and business security standards and how to manage these standards. This standard contains guidelines and best practices and recommendations for several information security domains like:
 
The ISO/IEC 27001 is quite different from ISO/IEC 27002 due to the mere fact that ISO/IEC 27001 details the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, managing and improving an ISMS in an organization. Where ISO/IEC 27002 points out the management of the business concepts per se, ISO/IEC 27001 details each business cycle, business component, information asset to a cycle model known as the PDCA (Plan Do Check Act) model that aims to establish, implement, monitor and manage the information security cycle.
