What's even worse, on my computer (Windows 8.1), the installed printer HP Officejet 7610 Series Class Driver (that wasn't recognaizin A3 papper size), started to appear as Offline all the time. I started being NOT able even to print in any size!
 
Since you are using Windows 8 and not Windows 7, the only other drivers available would be the Class drivers which are Windows preinstalled drivers. (Basic Drivers) The best drivers to use are the actual model name.

I am having this same issue of not able to print on A3-size paper. I had a 6 month old HP 8610 printer that I replaced with the HP7610 for the sole purpose of being able to print A3. However, A3 is not one of the paper options available on the drop down menu list.
 
In an attempt to correct the problem, I have tried updating the driver as suggested, but the only drive update available is the Type 4, not the Type 3 as suggested. I have this printer directly connected to the docking station of my 6 month old MS Surface Pro III. The Surface Pro does not have a disc drive slot, so any recommendation to load the driver directly from the disc is not an option either.
 
Scanner would not stay connected to my computer. Finally tried to fix it following the directions on the HP Support website. Uninstalled and reinstalled the full software etc. Now it just says Driver is unavailable. I have tried every download, the Print and Scan Doctor on and on to correct the issue. I can use the scanner through what is not the HP Smart App that just keeps installing but I have not functionality of the HP Printer Software. I click on the program and it immediately takes me to the connect printer set-up which I go through and it finds the printer but the software will not open when clicked on again. Just keeps looping me through. Went out and tired to install the HP Drivers through the device manager where it is just listed as an unknown device but I get an error saying the driver is not signed or not signed properly. See image attached. I cannot print from my computer to this printer. Very frustrated at this point.
 
Try these the steps :

Note that if you have other printers installed, you will need to reinstall those printers after doing this.

1. Uninstall the HP Software from your PC.
2. Do a registry backup before making any registry changes, this document will be useful :
 
I moved from one house to another and updated the ip address of my printer. Windows however decidede to change the driver to class driver and prevented me from updating the driver to the series driver, the driver I had previously used for the printer where it was working well. My solution was to reset my PC to factory setting and start from the beginning again. Now it seems to work

I have been through all of your advises but nothing has worked. It is not a problem on one computer, but on two, funny enough both HP working on windows 7. Why have a class driver for HP 7610 that does not support A3 printing? It might be used for other printers, but ours are specific A3 printers who need to be able to print in A3. Please inform Microsoft that the default driver should be the series driver, not the class driver.
 
Got a user call on Friday right before the time to leave and he had a rather interesting issue. His printer is an HP OfficeJet 7610 and the option to print an 11"x17" paper format was completely gone from his drop down list of options. He has the options to print 8"x11", legal, etc. Here are the troubleshooting steps that I have already taken:
 
Usually the paper options are controlled by the driver. Perhaps Windows Update updated it and you lost the option? Rolling back might solve this. Otherwise, delete the printer and remove the driver, get the latest from HP, and reinstall the printer using the new driver.
 
The scanner driver is installed; I can scan from the Windows Devices and Printers" control panel, and I can scan with Vuescan, so I know the scanner works. What do I need to do to get it to work with the HP scanning software?
 
The manual is no help; it says to open the printer software and "In the window that appears, select Print, Scan & Fax or Print & Scan, and then select Scan a Document or Photo under Scan." The only option the printer software offers is "Print."
 
The document you pointed me to did not solve my problem, which is that the HP Scan software cannot find the scanner. I can scan from the Windows control panel and from a third-party application called VueScan.
 
I have resolved this problem: When I set up the machine, I installed the printer software and drivers from the CD that came in the box. So I downloaded the printer software from the HP Web site and installed that, and now everything is working as it should.
 
I found an EZ fix and blogged it. I just bought one and after pulling my hair out trying to get the scanner to work, found this fix. I don't use the feeder for anything, but use the flatbed often. And for those that don't think it's a full 11x17 scanner, it really is and does work.
 

Thank you for posting your query, I'll be more than glad to help you out.

I understand that you facing issues with the scanner of your HP OfficeJet 7610 Wide Format e-All-in-One printer.
 
That solution, Selecting the "HP Officejet 7610 series" driver instead of the default "HP Officejet 7610 series **Class driver**" did the trick. Thank you. Too bad HP hasn't figured this out and fixed it!
 
I was not able to print 13x19. I called HP and was told there wasn't anything they could do to help. That is was not an HP problem it was a microsoft problem and to call them. I did not take his advice. I knew that it had to be a HP problem. I started doing searches to find a solution and after many hits that suggested solutions, I finally found your post. It worked. Thank you so much
 
The problem concerns model CR769A. The Wi-Fi router was changed and the old settings were copied to the new one. The printer worked with one computer but scanning from another resulted to message "Scanner not found". Trying to install the printer again led to an endless "Installing printer" -screen. Using HP Print & Scan Doctor suggested that the software is not fully installed but letting the Doctor install the software ended into same result. Basic printer driver could be installed through Windows conrol panel.
 
A hard reset has been done. Manual and automatic IP have been tried. 7610 can be contacted by it's IP from browser and Wi-Fi connection seems to be ok. Only the installation software cannot install, though the device is found. What next?
 
Welcome to the HP Forums. I would be happy to help you with your HP Officejet 7610 printer. I understand that you are getting Scanner not found error message and you have already done some preliminary troubleshooting.
 
HP software for 7610 has now been removed and register cleaned by application provided by Microsoft support. Still installing the printer by "HP Print & Scan Doctor" tries to install the basic software first. The device is found and can be selected. Then "Installing network printer"- window opens and runs for a long time and finally gives up and suggests a new try. The same happens with ethernet cable connected.
 
In order for me to further assist you with your concern, could you please provide the following?:
-Is this a new issue or has it occurred since after installing Nitro Pro? Any changes you are aware of before this happened?
-The serial number of your Nitro Pro. This matters because our business installers are different from the online ones. To send me a private message, hover your mouse on top of my name 'AllainU' and select 'Message'.
-Nitro Pro build (format is 12.X.X.X, e.g. 12.0.0.112) you are working with. You can find this out by clicking on 'About Nitro Pro' under the Help tab or you can go to Control Panel > Programs and Features.
 
I have worked my way through the various articles and having done this Nitro now comes up with an error message 'The HP Officejet 7610 was not found' which is rather strange when it provides it as an option.
 
I had a similar problem when I bought a Canon D480 Multi-function machine several years. I curse all of the sellers of scanners who do not include a TWAIN driver with their software. I called Customer Support, searched the Internet and finally found several positive reviews of a free TWAIN driver called FreeKapture. The version I downloaded is ver 2 and a search I just did found that this is still the current version available today. That means it is a VERY stable driver. I have been using FreeKapture since I do not know when with no problems. Here is one site you can get the driver: -tools/Other-Office-Tools/FreeKapture.shtml. Ignore the Green START NOW buttons. Read the description text and scroll down to a BLUE DOWNLOAD button that has "FreeKapture 2.0 for Windows" on the right side of it. Click the BLUE DOWNLOAD and you will download a ZIP file. The Zip file will have a Setup.exe file. Extract that file and run it. The TWAIN driver will be installed into its own folder. If I remember correctly, In your scanner software you will have to find a menu option to find the TWAIN driver. Just remember the folder where it was installed to which was included during the Setup process. Once you have pointed your scanner to the TWAIN driver you should be free to scan your life away.
