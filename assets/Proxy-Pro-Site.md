When a client makes a request to a target server, the request is first sent to the proxy server, which then forwards the request to the target server. The response from the target server is then sent back to the proxy server, which in turn sends it back to the client. The main purpose of a web proxy is to act as a barrier between a client and the internet, allowing for tasks such as caching, filtering, and anonymity.
 
You might need a web proxy for a number of reasons. One of the most common uses is to unblock websites and bypass geographical restrictions or censorship. By routing your internet requests through a web proxy, you can hide your IP address and access websites that may be restricted in your region. Additionally, a web proxy can also be used for security and privacy purposes. For example, it can help protect your identity by hiding your IP address from websites and online services that you access. A web proxy can also act as a filter, blocking unwanted or potentially harmful content. Caching is another important function of web proxies, as they can store frequently accessed content locally, reducing the load on the target server and speeding up access times for users. Overall, a web proxy can provide a range of benefits, including improved security, privacy, and access to restricted content.

Recently I have been receiving DMCA complaints through Google. From what I see sometimes my proxy is used to access illegal content like a movie website and then that link is shared on forums or Facebook etc. Google caches these pages and companies like Sony finds them and sends a complaint.

To be fair, if I received an email from the companies themselves I would make a system that blocks links, but with a DMCA I think blocking the link would imply wrongdoing and would cause the complaint to stick in Google's system.
 
The notice that we received, with any personally identifying information removed, may be found on the website of Chilling Effects, a third-party aggregator of legal complaint notices, at **chillingeffects.org link full of links to illegal movies**
 
File a Counter Notice If you feel that your sites or pages were mistakenly removed due to a DMCA request filed against you, Google can reinstate these materials into our search results upon receipt of a DMCA Counter Notification. Speak to a lawyer If you have legal questions about this notification, you may wish to speak to your own lawyer.
 
I drafted this answer many days ago but did not complete it. My intention is to define red flag notice. However, I'm hitting Submit because I think it's a good question and hope this will inspire other answers.
 
It seems like your immediate question, regarding the DCMA notices which Google is forwarding, is not a legal question. It is a question that can only be answered by Google and is dependent on their practices. Frankly though, it seems to me that Google search results might not be important based on the purpose of your proxy service. However perhaps your user base has evolved.
 
17 U.S. Code 512 - Limitations on liability relating to material online is one of the sections created by the DMCA. It is sometimes referred to as the safe harbor. You can read about it on Wikipedia page for the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act.
 
The "red flag" test contains both a subjective and an objective element. Subjectively, the OSP must have knowledge that the material resides on its system. Objectively, the "infringing activity would have been apparent to a reasonable person operating under the same or similar circumstances."
 
The reason that notice is important is that the safe harbor provided is only available if you do not know that infringing is happening. Plaintiff's prove knowledge through the letter or through red flags.
 
So the question for you is - do the letters forwarded by Google mean that you have knowledge and are outside of the safe harbor? Well that's the question that lawyers fight about! In fact Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. v. Fung, 710 F.3d 1020 (9th Cir., 2013) is all about that fight. If you read that case you will see that Fung was doing a bunch of shit that totally made it completely obvious that he was infringing. And he was earning money directly from it. He was screwed from the start.
 
Regarding your legal exposure, I always assume that a cease and desist letter will precede a lawsuit. With that said, only you know how much infringing is coming across your server. Fung made his money directly from the infringement. He attracted website visitors specifically because of the infringement. He had emails and other documents proving this.
 
Diebold is interesting because they attempted to use copyright to control the spread of their emails. First the court said no commercial harm and no diminishment of value of the works. Then the court found that the stuff wasn't even subject to copyright. This is obviously not a typical case. But it sounds like you see yourself as OPG in this case. **I don't see how you can become a plaintiff against bona fide copyright holders who follow the links as far as your server**. As I understand it, you are a reasonable target of the the notices, that's the result of running the proxy. However, I might be getting out of my technical depth here.
 
I am using a proxy and have configured the proxy.config. If I run the site locally on my machine with the proxy site as HTTP it works calling the HTTPS service, but if doesn't work when going from HTTPS to HTTPS in our production environment.
 
I wonder if HTTPS to HTTPS communication is not configured correctly. I can ping the proxy, but it does not pass along the user name and password to a secured service and only works with non secured services when using HTTP but not with HTTPS
 
**Edit** - looking into it further, I found out that my proxy ping is failing. Trying to troubleshoot that first, but also lost there. I've found tons of help docs and threads that say "try proxy.ashx?ping to see if your proxy is working" but none of them say what to do if the ping fails.
 
**Edit 2** - turns out that the password for the account used to access the arcgis server service had special characters in it that were causing the proxy to fail. I changed the password and removed the special characters and things are now working fine.
 
I am trying to use the Convert Document action for the first time. I have it set up so it's available to use in a workflow but when I run the workflow I get the following error: "Error converting document. There is no word services application proxy for this site collection."
 
Hi, we are going to have a new wordpress website. We currently have the main website (built using jekyll) on Netlify with www.parent.com main domain. We want to have a subfolder path www.parent.com/stepchildren to point to another website built with self-hosted wordpress (stepchildren.parent.com). I have few questions:
 
I want the URL to show main domain with subfolder path. For example, when I typed greggaven.online/wp in the browser, it will show the page of nointervention.wpengine.com, greggaven.online/wp/blog will show nointervention.wpengine.com/blog and so on. The browser will show the URL of the main domain greggave.online/wp/\* but displays the pages from WordPress.
 
To accomplish this, I added nointervention.gregraven.online as a domain in the WPEngine dashboard for this site. I also added a CNAME entry with NameCheap that points the nointervention.gregraven.online to nointervention.wpengine.com. Finally, I added an instruction in \_redirects to route all requests to nointervention to WPEngine.
 
Type in nointervention.gregraven.online or gregraven.online/nointervention and you are shown content from nointervention.wpengine.com, but with nointervention.gregraven.online in the URL section in the browser.
 
The second issue is, css and js is not rendered properly because the wordpress site is on http. After I changed it to https by adding SSL. The 200 redirect from will be forced to 301 redirect towards and the browser will show the subdomain instead of subfolder path on apex domain.
 
You previous latest example was the other way around (APEX domain on WordPress). While in our case, the APEX domain www.dremio.com is on Netlify.
