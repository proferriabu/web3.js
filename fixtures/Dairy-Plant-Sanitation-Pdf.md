Food Protection's Dairy Sanitation Licensing and Inspection Program inspects these dairy farms at least once every six months to make sure the conditions on the farms meet New Hampshire standards. Samples of milk and water are collected and tested to check quality.
 
Milk pasteurization plants provide a critical step to ensure the safety of the milk and milk products available to New Hampshire citizens. These milk plants may produce fluid milk, yogurt, cheese or ice cream. All milk plants located within New Hampshire are required to be licensed by the Department of Health and Human Services. The Dairy Sanitation Inspection and Licensing Program inspects the milk plants regularly to make sure the plants comply with all regulations. The Program also conducts complicated tests on milk pasteurizers at least once every 3 months to ensure the milk and milk products are processed and handled properly. Samples of pasteurized milk and milk products are collected and tested to check for quality and proper pasteurization.

Both milk plant inspection and farm inspection are standardized under a national cooperative program that includes all fifty states, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the dairy industry.
 
Food Protection's Dairy Sanitation Inspection and Licensing Program provides licensing and regulation of milk producers, milk processors, distributors and producer/distributors, bulk milk haulers and milk routes located in New Hampshire, and licensing of milk processors, distributors and producer/distributors located outside the state whose products are sold in New Hampshire.

Pre-permitting consultation is provided at the request of the applicant and is strongly recommended by the Dairy Sanitation Inspection and Licensing Program. Once issued, milk producer permits remain in effect until 6 months after the dairy operation ceases unless the permit is revoked. Permits are not transferable with regards to persons or locations.
 
When I first started working in a dairy plant, Richard Nixon was president and it cost me 36 cents per gallon to put gasoline in my car. We cleaned the dairy using flake caustic soda and sanitized with hot water or chlorine. A 14-day shelf life was considered excellent for fluid milk. My, how things have changed.
 
Yet some things remain the same. Clean is still clean; dirty is still dirty. And we still have not developed an effective way to sanitize dirty equipment. Sanitation is still the most critical process in a dairy plant operation. Effective cleaning and sanitizing of equipment and environmental surroundings are still essential. Sanitation remains the first step in dairy processing to produce high-quality and safe products for consumers.
 
Today, most dairy plant operations are highly sophisticated with automated clean-in-place (CIP) systems and well-designed processing equipment. The success or failure of a sanitation program, however, is often dependent on those old-fashioned manual and clean-out-of-place (COP) methods. Let's look at some of the very basic procedures that are necessary for success.
 
**CIP Cleaning,** like manual and COP cleaning, is dependent on the application of the basic principles of cleaning: time, temperature, velocity, and chemical concentration. While CIP systems are automated, it is critical that these parameters are monitored each time the system is used. The effectiveness of CIP cleaning is dependent on the proper application of these four principles. Automated systems do fail; thus, they must be monitored by properly trained individuals.
 
**Environmental cleaning** and monitoring is the fourth practice that cannot be overlooked. The overall environment of the facility must be cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis. These procedures are performed as scheduled and monitored with a robust swabbing program. Remember: A dairy plant and its equipment are either dirty or clean. Following these four best practices is the first step to producing high-quality, wholesome dairy products in your facility. Properly maintained equipment and trained people are essential to an effective sanitation program.

This IMS List is provided as an on-line guide to assist regulatory program management and others who utilize the IMS List to stay current by providing continuous updates. The IMS List is also posted on FDA's Website as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file quarterly by the FDA Milk Safety Team at the bottom of this page.\*
 
As announced in the July 2005 issue of the IMS List, due to budget constraints, the printed version of the IMS List has been discontinued. Beginning in January 2006, it is being made available on FDA's web site in PDF format with notification of availability given by an electronic mailing list.
 
Interstate milk shippers who have been certified by Milk Sanitation Rating Officers (SROs) as having attained the identified milk sanitation compliance and enforcement ratings are indicated on the following IMS List. These ratings/certifications are based on compliance with the requirements of the latest revision of the USPHS/FDA Grade "A" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO) and were made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the latest revision of the Methods of Making Sanitation Rating of Milk Shippers and the Certifications/Listings of Single Service Containers and/or Closures for Milk and/or Milk Products Manufacturers (MMSR).
 
\*Proposal 301 that was passed at the 2001 NCIMS Conference, held May 5-10, 2001, in Wichita, Kansas, and concurred with by FDA states: "Transfer Stations, Receiving Stations and Milk Plants must achieve a Sanitation Compliance Rating of 90 or better in order to be eligible for a listing on the IMS List. Sanitation Compliance Rating scores for Transfer and Receiving Stations and Milk Plants will not be printed on the IMS List". Therefore, the publication of a Sanitation Compliance Rating score for Transfer and Receiving Stations and Milk Plants will not be printed on the IMS List.
 
\*Proposal 316 that was passed at the 2003 NCIMS Conference, held April 16-May 1, 2003 in Seattle, WA, and concurred with by FDA authorized the NCIMS Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Listing of milk plants, receiving stations and transfer stations. The HACCP Listing shall be made by a Milk Sanitation Rating Officer who has been certified to conduct HACCP Listings by a USPHS/FDA representative. Milk plants, receiving stations and transfer stations must achieve an acceptable HACCP Listings in order to be eligible for a listing on the IMS List.
 
\*Proposal 309 that was passed at the 2015 NCIMS Conference, held April 24-29, 2015 in Portland, OR, and concurred with by FDA, authorized single-service containers and/or closures for milk and/or milk products manufacturing plants to be eligible for certification/listing on the IMS List that they shall have a Sanitation Compliance Rating of eighty (80) or above. It also stated that the publication of a Sanitation Compliance Rating score for single-service containers and/or closures for milk and/or milk products manufacturing plants will not be printed on the IMS List.
 
The rules for inclusion on the IMS List were formulated by the official voting representatives of State Milk Regulatory and Rating Agencies and FDA who have participated in the conferences of the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (NCIMS). These rules are as follows:
 
USPHS/FDA will not include on the IMS List the certification/listing of any single-service containers and/or closures for milk and/or milk products manufacturer unless the written signed permission of the manufacturer concerned has been obtained by the Rating Agency or SCC, as applicable.
 
We are limiting the company's name to the name of the parent organization or its subsidiary, but not both. If the preferred name is not indicated on the Form FDA 2359i or Form FDA 2359d, as applicable, the editor will select the name which is considered appropriate
 
The voluntary national uniform coding system, developed by the National Labeling Committee and recommended for utilization by the ninth NCIMS (1963), is a system for the identification of milk plants at which milk and/or milk products are packaged by means of nationally recognized State and plant code numbers identified on the package. It is exclusively applicable to milk and/or products pasteurized in a milk plant other than shown under the trade name, distributor's names, or private label. If this voluntary national uniform
