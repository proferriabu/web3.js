As an official Old Guy at 54 years old, I really prefer to have a hardcopy of study materials instead of spending more time staring at a screen. I read the Pocket Guide to the PCCET Exam on Linked-In, and the author mentions that the official study guide can be purchased on the Palo Alto website. I cannot find a link to purchase the study guide anywhere, however.
 

"The PCCET Study Guide, along with all other PCCET exam resources, can be accessed from the PCCET exam webpage on our website ( -alto-networks-certified-cybersecurity-entry...). Note the Study Guide is freely available. It's also worth noting that Emily Paul is not a real person--it's a bot designed to direct individuals to an entity that sells exam dumps and gray market training materials."

Other available languages are listed in the**Schedule Exam** section of the **Exam Details** webpage. If the examisn't available in your preferred language, you can request anadditional 30 minutes to complete the exam.
 
Key to understanding the table: The topic groups (also known asfunctional groups) are in bold typeface followed by the objectiveswithin each group. The table is a comparison between the two versions ofthe exam skills measured and the third column describes the extent ofthe changes.

Next, drag one key concept into each quadrant on the canvas. This is where you will dive deeper into each concept by collecting notes and ideas, making connections, summarizing the concept, and creating example quiz questions. Mark the concepts with red, yellow, or green to show your confidence level with each concept.
 
Each study quadrant consists of four sections to organize your study material. Once you have placed your primary concept in the center of the quadrant, you can start filling in the four sections with supporting material. The quadrant sections are as follows:
 
Identify and add the main concepts discussed in your class into the blue rectangles in Section 1. Main concepts may include chapter titles, key terms, or course concepts to further elaborate on. If your teacher or professor provides a test outline, highlight those core concepts here.
 
Use the quadrants for diving deeper into each concept by collecting notes and ideas, making connections, compiling quiz questions, and summarizing learnings. You can mark quadrants red, yellow, or green to show your confidence level with each concept.
 
Your teacher or professor may have provided a test outline of the core concepts covered on your test. Include only the notes that cover the main ideas on your test outline. Discarding unneeded information lets you focus on what matters most.

Where is the Study Guide for the Digital Marketing certification exam? Looked all over the course and cannot locate. I chatted with customer service and they could not find it either. Said they would research and get back to me. Thank you!
 
I'm unable to access the study guide for the Digital Marketing Certification exam. When I click on the cloud icon to download, I get a message that the page cannot be opened because a secure connection to the server could not be established. I get the same message using Chrome. Help please.
 
There's nothing in there that can be called a handbook. Watching the course and seeing the main ideas in the onedrive that the first commenter sent you is better. Thanks for the link, by the way. I downloaded it. I'm not the most experienced marketer right now. I'm trying to learn it on my own, but I still have a lot to learn. I started my first business. I'm in the cannabinoids business. I urgently needed the support of a marketing agency to promote the store. I didn't try to advertise it myself and found a marketing agency that specializes in cannabis stores. ePropel optimized my website, ran good ads, and did SEO.
 
Basically you loop over the content topic list, after which use a nested for loop over all your tags and compare an attribute to connect with online onedrive(I used slugs) to make certain you're matching the proper gadgets in the loops and show the wide variety of stay posts in case you are.

**What should I know about the 2022 edition of the study guides?**
The updates to **Study Guide 1** are minor and mostly involve updating the examples, statistics and links, and some clarification of language. If candidates are already using the 2019 edition to prepare for CGFM exam 1, we do **not** suggest purchasing the 2022 edition.
 
Updates to **Study Guide 2** are more extensive and involve a number of revisions in response to several federal regulations (including updates to lease and land standards (SFFAS 54 and 59), MD&A project and updates to A-136) and state and local regulations (including GASB statements 84-98, as applicable). If candidates want to use this study guide to prepare for CGFM exam 2, we suggest obtaining the 2022 edition for exams to be taken after July 2022. Alternatively, for those who already have the 2019 edition, we recommend supplementing it by visiting the applicable government sites to learn more about the recent regulation changes.
