When I configure my Windows 10 guest to use VBoxSVGA with 3D acceleration I can't start some programs. They immediately crash and the Windows event log shows that the crash happened in VBoxDispD3D-x86.dll.

In addition to the log and the crash details from the Windows event log I'll also attach a minimal sample program to reproduce the crash. It is just a small .NET WPF application that should show a GIF animation in a window.
 

One can click OK on the error pop up and continue without issue. Everything works and no functionality in the form is missing.

3. If the line "syslib.JNIsharedstubs.dll=1.0" is added in the webutil.32.properties file on the client desktop, relaunch the form and re-do the steps the error message does not occur.

This is a permanent workaround to prevent the error but jacob-1.18-M2-x86.dll is not downloaded.

4. jacob-1.18-M2-x86.dll is the correct size and is referenced correctly in the webutil.cfg file.

5. The webutil\_demo and another webutil application does not show the problem when run using the same config section as the failing application so this points to an application specific issue.

Does AlphaVSS.x64.dll actually exist on your system? It should be located in the subfolder alphavss, under the Duplicati program folder.
The alphavss folder should contain 3 files: AlphaVSS.Common.dll, AlphaVSS.x64.dll and AlphaVSS.x86.dll.
 
May I suggest adding all those necessary files to the Windows installer so that they are installed automatically with Duplicati? Also, it would be great to add this info to the error message and the VSS advanced option help text so that users can see the solution there instead of having to search forum threads about the error message. Thanks!
