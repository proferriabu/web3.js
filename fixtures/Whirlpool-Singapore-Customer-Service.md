Our in-home delivery service handles large appliances too big for standard shipping carriers. If you purchased parts and accessories with a large appliance, we'll try to deliver those items together.

Love the fountain and strong massage effect so much ！！ Great Tub, enjoy my bathing everyday . Thanks you Singaporebathtubs team, especially Andy. He is so helpful, answer all my questions and also provide me much info on heater storage options and selection.
 
Wasted few weekends doing window shopping in central area until we last found Singaporebathtubs via Google . Best place to look out for bathtubs. Reasonable pricing and good customer service. Sale guy Andy provide great help and lias well with my ID throughout.
 
**Q: Is the bathtub suitable for HDB?**
**A:** All the bathtubs that you find here at SingaporeBathtubs are specially made for HDB in terms of size and weight. The weight of our bathtubs are between 30kg-50Kg. Add a person into the bathtub, and we should be talking about 250kg max, which is well within the max loading weight allowed in HDB.
