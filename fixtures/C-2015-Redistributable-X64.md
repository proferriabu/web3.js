I am writing an application with MKL that, upon launching, requires mkl\_core.dll and mkl\_intel\_thread.dll. As my MKL redist directory is not in %PATH%, I copied these to the application place. Then it asks for libiomp5md.dll, which comes in the redistribution packages here: -us/articles/redistributable-libraries-for-intel-c-and-fortran-2018-compilers-for-windows. When running, say, a FFT method, it asks for mkl\_avx2.dll or mkl\_def.dll. I also have to copy one of these from the MKL redist directory to the app directory. So my questions are:

Of the versions you have listed, each one could either be a patch (in which case you'd be removing bug fixes and features by removing it) or a new version (in which case you'd be removing a redistributable that a program depends on). In either case, removing it would be unwise unless you have some real need to do it.
 
I doubt there is an easy way to know what you need without knowing which programs depend on them. These redistributables are usually included with programs that depend on them. Even if they are technically compatible with future versions they may be hard coded to use a specific version. My advice would be to leave it alone.
 
You can actually remove any of them. If a program doesn't function properly afterward, simply reinstall the program. It will reinstall what it needs. Otherwise you'll be accumulating a lot of junk that might do nothing.
 
After a few web searches I gathered these files were parts of the Visual C++ redistributable for Visual Studio 2015. Many sites advised me to download and install the said Visual C++ redistributable, which I did. But the problem persists. So, I uninstalled 5.4 and went back and installed 5.3.5.
 
Hello everyone, I tried to install wireshark with windows x64 but i've got the following error :"wireshark error the visual c++ redistributable installer failed with error 5. Unable to continue installation. "
 
**Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable** is an installer for Microsoft C and C++ runtime libraries. Many apps, programs, and games created using these two languages require the installation of these libraries to function correctly. The Visual C++ architecture installed must match the application's architecture to be run.
 
Sometimes, when installing a very recent game, it may not work. Most games usually include several additional installation packages, but sometimes they don't. When you download them from gaming platforms such as Steam, these redistributables are usually automatically installed on your computer.

If you've had Windows installed on your computer for several years, you will likely see redistributables installed from different years and versions, such as 2010, 2013, 2015, and 2022. This is because there are programs designed to work with a specific version of these libraries. Here at Uptodown, we offer downloads for the latest available versions for both 32- and 64-bit, taking into account that many are no longer supported.
 
Uptodown is a multi-platform app store specialized in Android. Our goal is to provide free and open access to a large catalog of apps without restrictions, while providing a legal distribution platform accessible from any browser, and also through its official native app.
 
In the first instance, as that should already help, can she please reinstall SketchUp itself? If that does not do the trick, and I know this is a bit cumbersome, but could you then also remove the existing redistributable files and make sure to re-install them again through the following installer **here**which you shall also please run as administrator if possible.
 
**Freely redistributable software** (**FRS**) is software that anyone is free to redistribute. The term has been used to mean two types of free to redistribute software, distinguished by the legal modifiability and limitations on purpose of use of the software. FRS which can be legally modified and used for any purpose is the same as free software. Non-legally modifiable FRS is freeware, shareware or similar.
 
The non-modifiable FRS generally comes in the form of executable binaries and is often used by proprietary software companies and authors to showcase their work or to encourage the user to buy full products from them (in the case of shareware, demo or trial versions). Freeware that is not restricted to be obtained from a specific distributor is also FRS.[*clarification needed*]
 
In cases of firmware or microcode, it is acceptable for major open-source projects like OpenBSD to include a binary firmware of a device within the distribution,[1] as long as said firmware runs only on the external device in question, and not on the main CPU where the operating system itself is running.However, for such an inclusion to be in place, the binary firmware must be distributed under an adequate licence,[1] like ISC or BSD, and must not require a discriminatory contract to be in place.[2]A lack of such licence is why wireless devices from Intel Corporation do not work out of the box in almost all open-source distributions, whereas Ralink wireless cards work just fine.[2][1]
 
According to PSSE documentation, Fortran redistributable is sufficient to "use" user defined models supplied to you by others, but if you want to "compile Fortran code" you would need a Fortran compiler. However, my confusion is that sometimes models are sent as .obj and .lib files and would need to be compiled to dsusr.dll using Cload.bat. In this case, is the redistributable sufficient? or do I need the Fortran compiler?
