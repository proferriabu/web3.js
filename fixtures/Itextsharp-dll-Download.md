I have been able to add a reference to it and Choose Items... for the toolbox in Pega Robotics after I edited AssemblyInfo.cs and changed the false to true as in [assembly: ComVisibleAttribute(true)]. But I can't seem to "Add Constructor for Type" for Interfaces declared in itextsharp.dll.

For example, when I click on "Add Constructor for Type" to iTextSharp.text.pdf.parser, I search in vain for ITextExtractionStrategy even though I know it is there because I can see it in the Solution Explorer for iTextSharp which I have easy access to because I had to recompile it as stated previously.
 
When using a third party assembly, it is probably best to use a script when possible. While you won't be able to get support on your specific script from the Pega support team, you are certain to find a wealth of knowledge on CodeProject or other sources on the web since the code will be operating with a third party assembly. For iTextSharp, I have used it in the past by creating a custom component or via a script.
 
My organization put in a service request, but I haven't gotten my hands on a release which contains the new PDF support. I'm very interested to see what you have come up with particularly after getting more familiar with iTextSharp. Working with PDFs is bringing back memories of my early days in programming. I did a lot of work with dot matrix plotters in the 1970's and 1980's.

I have a huge mess of files (around ten thousand) of various formats. Each file can be defined as a certain type (ex: product sheet, business plan, offer, presentation, etc). The files are in no particular order and might as well be looked at as a single list. I'm interested in creating a catalogue by type.
 
The idea is that, for a certain format and a certain type, I know what keywords to look for in the file's contents. I would like to have a powershell script that basically executes a series of scripts looking for all the files of a certain format containing specific keywords and outputting each list to a separate csv. The crucial point here is that the keyword will be in the content (body of a pdf, cell of an excel etc.) and not in the filename. As of now I've tried the following:
 
Powershell using itextsharp.dll. The below evaluates the text on each page of each pdf for keywords, then exports any matches to a csv. You can run with this to rename files if matches are found, move them to categorized folders, and the likes.
 
If the file contents of the PDF are indexed in Windows Search, you can query the system filesystem index. You may need to install an iFilter to ensure that Windows will index PDFs. But this method will then work with pdf, text files, xlsx files, etc.
