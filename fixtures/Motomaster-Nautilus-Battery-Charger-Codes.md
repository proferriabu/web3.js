Your charger requires a 120 V AC electrical wall outlet receptacle installed according to local codes and ordinances.**USING AN EXTENSION CORD**
An extension cord should not be used unless absolutely necessary. Use of an improper extension cord could result in a risk of fire and electric shock. If an extension cord must be used, make sure:

**FOLLOW THESE STEPS WHEN BATTERY IS OUTSIDE VEHICLE.**
**WARNING: A SPARK NEAR THE BATTERY MAY CAUSE A BATTERY EXPLOSION. TO REDUCE THE RISK OF A SPARK NEAR THE BATTERY:**
 
If a lead-acid battery is left sitting in a low state of charge, or is deeply discharged, or is never given the opportunity to fully charge, it can suffer capacity loss due to sulphation and/or stratification. Such a battery can appear to have a normal open circuit voltage and yet it will have a noticeable drop in performance. Using Reconditioning mode may help to reverse the affects of sulphation and stratification, restoring lost battery capacity.
To maximize battery life and performance, Recondition your battery once per year or after deep discharges. For best results, take the battery through a normal full charge cycle before using this mode. A Reconditioning charge can take up to 4 hours to complete.CAUTION: USE THIS MODE WITH CARE. RECONDITIONING USES A HIGH CHARGING VOLTAGE AND MAY CAUSE WATER LOSS IN THE BATTERY. IT IS BEST SUITED FOR WET (FLOODED) BATTERIES WITH REMOVABLE VENT CAPS WHICH ALLOWS FOR WATER LEVELS TO BE TOPPED UP. RECONDITIONING IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR AGM OR GEL BATTERIES. TO MINIMUM RISK OF HIGH VOLTAGE TO SENSITIVE ELECTRONICS, DISCONNECT THE BATTERY FROM THE VEHICLE (OR ANY OTHER EQUIPMENT) WHEN USING THIS MODE.

**STAGE 1 DESULPHATION\***
Pulses of voltage and current help recover sulphated or deeply discharged batteries.
**STAGE 2 SOFT START\***
Gently introduces current to condition deeply discharged batteries and prevent overheating that could damage the battery.
**STAGE 3 BULK**
Charging with maximum current to bring the battery to about 80% capacity.
**STAGE 4 ABSORPTION**
Charging with constant voltage while reducing current to safely bring the battery to 100% capacity. This stage is key to maximizing battery performance and battery life.
**STAGE 5 ANALYZE**
Tests if battery is holding charge.
**STAGE 6 MAINTENANCE**
Monitors battery voltage and provides top-up charging when necessary to keep battery fully charged.
