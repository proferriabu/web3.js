My learning experience with Simplilearn was enriching and valuable. It will undoubtedly help me to transition into my new chosen field of Cybersecurity. I liked the live virtual classes as well as the recorded sessions.
 
This international association focuses on IT governance, providing benchmarks and governance tools for organizations that employ information systems. ISACA is behind the creation, sponsorship, and driving of the COBIT framework.
 
ISACA released a more comprehensive version in 1998. It enveloped areas beyond audit controls. The third and fourth versions, released in the 2000s, added further management guidelines around cyber security.
 
The fifth COBIT version came in 2013 and brought along tools, objectives, and best practices universally applicable to all IT operations in enterprises. It expanded on the fourth version by incorporating related standards from the ISO (International Organization for Standardization), including ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library.

ISACA then updated COBIT 5 to COBIT 2019. It is the latest version. This COBIT version is more comprehensive, flexible, and suitable for all enterprises, irrespective of their immediate goals or size. COBIT 2019 includes six governing principles, unlike COBIT 5, which had five. Also, in this version, the number of processes supporting management objectives and governance has increased from 37 to 40.
 
The COBIT framework provides a common language for IT professionals, compliance auditors, and business executives. They can communicate with each other on the same IT goals, controls, objectives and outcomes.
 
The COBIT business orientation includes linking business goals with its IT infrastructure by providing various maturity models and metrics that measure the achievement while identifying associated business responsibilities of IT processes. The main focus of COBIT 4.1 was illustrated with a process-based model subdivided into four specific domains, including:
 
The latest COBIT version 5 came out in April 2012 and consolidated the principles of COBIT 4.1, Risk IT Frameworks, and Val IT 2.0. This version draws reference from IT Assurance Framework (ITAF) from ISACA and the revered BMIS (Business Model for Information Security).
 
COBIT is more than a set of technical standards for IT managers. This framework supports the requirements of businesses via combined IT applications, related processes and sources. It provides the following two main parameters:
 
COBIT 5.0 addressed all the criticisms in a sustainable manner. It now encourages all organizations to govern and manage information in the most holistic and integrated manner. The guiding principles of COBIT 5.0 are:
 
In several cases, COBIT 5.0 has been appreciated for its ability to reduce the risk of IT implementations. IT initiatives typically require quick, agile adaptations that simultaneously need regular buy-ins from stakeholders and other users. The COBIT 5.0 framework has been able to bring about a collaborative culture within the organization and this better met the needs, risks, and benefits of all IT initiatives.
 
The professionals best suited for COBIT methodologies are those who are already in a position to understand the nuances of IT governance in business management practices. The course will be especially beneficial for:
 
While the modern world is gearing towards an environment of several emerging technologies, including Consumerisation, Cloud Computing, Social Media, Big Data and Mobility, information and IT is easily the new currency. Technology ensues massive volumes of information chunks to be easily supported and managed. This raises the success rate of businesses, but at the same time raises other challenging and complex management and governance concerns for the security professionals, enterprise leaders, and governance specialists. New businesses demand that risk scenarios are better met with the power of information. COBIT 5.0 is the exact solution the modern businesses are asking for.
 
When it comes to meeting stakeholder needs, COBIT has emerged as a leading framework. COBIT provides a comprehensive and structured approach to integrating stakeholder requirements into an organization's governance and management processes. COBIT also helps ensure that these requirements are met in a consistent and efficient manner. In this way, COBIT can be seen as a key tool for meeting stakeholder needs.

As organizations strive to improve their overall performance, they are increasingly adopting holistic approaches to governance. This means taking into account the organization's entire ecosystem when making decisions about how to best manage risks and optimize resources.
 
One framework that can be used to support a holistic approach to governance is COBIT. COBIT provides a comprehensive set of guidelines, tools and techniques that can be used to help organizations effectively govern their enterprise IT resources.
 
When adopting COBIT, it is important to keep in mind that the framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Rather, it should be customized to meet the specific needs of the organization. Additionally, COBIT should be integrated with other frameworks and standards, such as ITIL and ISO 27001, to ensure that the organization's governance program is comprehensive and effective.

First released in 1996, COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) was initially designed as a set of IT control objectives to help the financial audit community better navigate the growth of IT environments. In 1998, the ISACA released version 2, which expanded the framework to apply outside the auditing community. Later, in the 2000s, the ISACA developed version 3, which brought in the IT management and information governance techniques found in the framework today.
 
COBIT 4 was released in 2005, followed by the refreshed COBIT 4.1 in 2007. These updates included more information regarding governance surrounding information and communication technology. In 2012, COBIT 5 was released and in 2013, the ISACA released an add-on to COBIT 5, which included more information for businesses regarding risk management and information governance.
 
COBIT 5 was released in 2012, but by 2019 a lot of changes were introduced around compliance and regulation standards in the industry, most notably the adoption of the European GDPR framework for data protection laws. Regulations went into effect in the spring of 2018 and the ISACA updated the governance principles of COBIT to accommodate this new focus, adding a 6th principle to the framework. While COBIT has always had a focus on regulations and compliance, these new standards helped shape the revised COBIT 2019 framework with an updated lens on governance management. For organizations embarking on digital transformation, COBIT helps navigate the complexities of IT compliance, regulation, and governance.
 
COBIT 2019 introduced three new governance principles that revolve around the openness and flexibility of the framework. The framewor
