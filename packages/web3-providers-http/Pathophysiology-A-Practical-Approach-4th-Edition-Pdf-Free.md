This document provides information about the third edition of the textbook "Pathophysiology: A Practical Approach" by Lachel Story. It was published in 2018 by Jones & Bartlett Learning and discusses pathophysiology from a nursing perspective. The book contains 7 chapters that cover cellular function, immunity, hematopoietic function, cardiovascular function, respiratory function, fluid/electrolyte/acid-base homeostasis, and urinary function. It is intended to help nurses understand disease processes and apply pathophysiological principles to patient care.Read less

High altitude can be a hostile environment and a paradigm of how environmental factors can determine illness when human biological adaptability is exceeded. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of high-altitude sickness, including its epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatments. The first section of our work defines high altitude and considers the mechanisms of adaptation to it and the associated risk factors for low adaptability. The second section discusses the main high-altitude diseases, highlighting how environmental factors can lead to the loss of homeostasis, compromising important vital functions. Early recognition of clinical symptoms is important for the establishment of the correct therapy. The third section focuses on high-altitude pulmonary edema, which is one of the main high-altitude diseases. With a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of high-altitude diseases, as well as a reasoned approach to environmental or physical factors, we examine the main high-altitude diseases. Such an approach is critical for the effective treatment of patients in a hostile environment, or treatment in the emergency room after exposure to extreme physical or environmental factors.

Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is an increasingly recognized complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) with high morbidity and mortality. The triad of endothelial cell activation, complement dysregulation, and microvascular hemolytic anemia has the potential to cause end organ dysfunction, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death, but clinical features mimic other disorders following HSCT, delaying diagnosis. Recent advances have implicated complement as a major contributor and the therapeutic potential of complement inhibition has been explored. Eculizumab has emerged as an effective therapy and narsoplimab (OMS721) has been granted priority review by the FDA. Large studies performed mostly in pediatric patients suggest that earlier recognition and treatment may lead to improved outcomes. Here we present a clinically focused summary of recently published literature and propose a diagnostic and treatment algorithm.
 
The incidence and mortality of TA-TMA varies widely due to heterogeneous diagnostic criteria, under-recognition, and the wide variety of treatments that are used. The incidence was estimated to be 8.2% in a comprehensive literature review published in 2004 aggregating the outcomes of 5423 allotransplant patients. One large review found a mortality rate of 75% with the majority of patients dying within 3 months of TA-TMA diagnosis [14]. Jodele et al. estimated the incidence of TA-TMA to be 39% in pediatric and young adult patients, with 20% having clinically meaningful disease however the majority of these patients underwent HSCT for nonmalignant diseases [15]. A recent, large review of nearly 2000 adult HSCT patients by Postalcioglu et al. using the City of Hope criteria (Table 1) identified 13% to have definite TMA and an additional 26% to have probable TMA [3]. Only 17% were clinically diagnosed, suggesting that this syndrome is under-recognized. In another large retrospective review done by Gavriilaki et al. of 758 HSCT recipients from a single institution over 27 years, the incidence of TA-TMA as defined by the International Working Group criteria was 15.5% [5]. Response rates vary from 25 to 93%, with lower response rates reported with plasma exchange and higher response rates with complement directed therapy. Mortality rates range from 40 to 84% [8, 10, 11, 16,17,18]. Higher response rates are reported with terminal complement directed therapy, but one study showed similar survival as compared with other therapies due to the increase in infectious complications that were not attributable to *N. meningitidis* [16].
 
TA-TMA is a syndrome of abnormal endothelial cell activation with features of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [19]. Defining features are endothelial injury and complement activation [15], without the depletion of ADAMTS13 as in primary TTP [20]. Various factors in the transplant process lead to development of endotheliitis and subsequent complement activation, formation of platelet rich thrombi, and microvascular hemolytic anemia that ultimately cascade into end organ dysfunction. A three hit hypothesis has been proposed: an underlying predisposition to complement activation or preexisting endothelial injury (hit 1), a toxic conditioning regimen causing endothelial injury (hit 2), followed by additional insults including medications, alloreactivity, and/or infections (hit 3). The accumulation of the three hits crosses a threshold triggering the activation of the complement cascade and microthrombi formation [21].
 
Endothelial injury leads to an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, procoagulant factors, and soluble adhesion molecules, which promote further endothelial injury and initiate and propagate the complement cascade [22, 23]. Nitric oxide depletion diminishes the vasodilatory properties of the vessel, decreases the release of P-selectin and von Willebrand factor, and leads to platelet aggregation and subsequent microthrombi development (Fig. 1) [24, 25]. These findings are consistent but nonspecific; development of TA-TMA appears dependent on poorly understood host factors. Recent studies confirm the role of complement activation, indicated by significant increases in C3b and sC4b-9 [15, 26]. Patients who acquired variants of complement system regulatory proteins from their donors appear to be at increased risk for TA-TMA, suggesting that patients and donors could potentially be screened for these mutational variants prior to HSCT [27]. An association of HLA-DRB1\*11 and idiopathic TTP has been recognized [28,29,30]. Among patients with TA-TMA, those with HLA-DRB1\*11 had significantly better outcomes [31].
 
The illustration is separated into two halves. The upper half demonstrates the numerous mechanisms that promote endothelial damage and the treatments targeting these promoters of injury. The lower half represents the effect the damaged endothelium has on protective factors of the endothelium and the treatments, which enhance these cytoprotective factors. Therapies shown as potential treatment options but have not been widely or rigorously studied include EPA, TNF-α inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab), bosentan, transdermal isosorbide tape, statins, iloprost, and recombinant thrombomodulin.
