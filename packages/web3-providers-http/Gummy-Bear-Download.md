you can take a lot of liberties with this. feel free to soak your bears in any kind of booze you want. **here is a handy drunken gummy bear guide**. if you prefer another fruit to apples, go right ahead. i like juicing some fruit and using the juice in addition to the cut up fruit, for more flavor. (**this juicer from williams-sonoma** is the one i use!) red wine is fine to use, although it might be difficult to see your little bears with that. i like using wine that's not too sweet, since there's already a lot of sugar involved with the fruit, fruit juice, and gummy bears. oh, and the wooden skewers topped with gummy bears do double duty: they're cute, and they help to fish the fruit and bears out of the bottom of the cup.
 
place your gummy bears in a jar or container, reserving a few to stick on top of some wooden skewers for serving. pour enough vodka in to cover your bears, cover the container, and let them soak at room temperature for eight hours, or overnight.

**Gummy bears** (German: *Gummibr*) are small, fruit gum candies, similar to a jelly baby in some English-speaking countries. The candy is roughly 2 cm (0.8 in) long and shaped in the form of a bear. The gummy bear is one of many gummies, popular gelatin-based candies sold in a variety of shapes and colors.
 
The success of gummy bears has spawned the production of many other gummy candies made to resemble animals and other objects, such as rings, worms, frogs, snakes, hamburgers, cherries, sharks, penguins, hippos, lobsters, octopuses, apples, peaches, oranges, *Ampelmnnchen*, Smurfs and spiders. Manufacturers offer a range of sizes including bears that weigh several kilograms.[2]
 
In the United States, Haribo gummy bears are sold in five flavors: raspberry (red); orange (orange); strawberry (green); pineapple (colorless); and lemon (yellow).[3] Trolli's bears are most often sold in five flavors in the United States, and in the same colors; however, Trolli's red bear is strawberry-flavored, while the green is lime and the colorless is grape.[4] Many companies emulate either Haribo or Trolli flavor-color combinations. Health-oriented brands, which often use all-natural flavors, sometimes opt for more and different flavors. For example, the boxed bulk gummies sold by Sunflower/Newflower Markets include grape, pineapple-coconut and peach, among others.
 
The traditional gummy bear is made from a mixture of sugar, glucose syrup, starch, flavoring, food coloring, citric acid and gelatin. However, recipes vary, such as organic candy, those suitable for vegetarians or those following religious dietary laws.
 
Production uses a specialized machine called a starch mogul. The image of the gummy bear is stamped into a tray filled with powdered starch. The hot, liquid mixture is poured into the indentations in the starch and allowed to cool overnight. Once the mixture has set, the candies can be removed from the mold and packaged.[5] The molds are open on top, so only the bear's front is formed while the back remains flat. The original design for each type of candy is carved into plaster by an artist, then duplicated by a machine and used to create the starch molds for the production line.[5]

Gummy bears made with bovine, porcine or piscine gelatin are not suitable for vegetarians and vegans. Those with porcine gelatin or from animals not slaughtered in either of the two contradictory ritualistic fashions do not conform to kashrut or halal dietary laws. In its factory in Turkey, Haribo produces halal bears and other sweets made with bovine gelatin.[3] Also, some gummy bears are made with pectin or starch instead of gelatin, making them suitable for vegetarians.
 
Large sour gummy bears are larger and flatter than regular ones, have a softer texture and include fumaric acid or other acid ingredients to produce a sour flavor. Some manufacturers produce sour bears with a different texture based on starch instead of gelatin. Typically, starch produces a shorter (cleaner bite, less chewy) texture than does gelatin.
 
Gummy bears ordinarily contain mostly empty calories, but recently[*when?*] gummy bears containing vitamin C, produced by manufacturers such as Sconza or Bear Essentials,[8] have been marketed to parents of young children. Gummy supplements containing vitamins have also been produced in the form of gummy bears to motivate consumption by young, picky eaters.
 
Gummy bears, and other gummy candy, stick to teeth and may cause tooth decay.[9] However, gummy bears containing the cavity-fighting additive xylitol (wood sugar) are now[*when?*] being tested.[10] Trolli has developed its "acti-line" of gummy candy that it claims will help the immune system and teeth.[11]
 
To prepare the boozy gummy bears, first measure out how much of the gummy bears you'll be using by filling up the champagne glasses to just below the level of a cupcake liner multiplied by how many glasses/cupcakes you'd like to make. Transfer this amount of gummy bears to a large container, such as a 9x13" Pyrex pan, and spread into an even layer.
 
Pour enough vodka over the gummy bears until they're just slightly but not totally submerged. Cover with plastic wrap and store in the fridge for a maximum of 24 hours. I stirred them up ever few hours to even out the distribution of vodka. When you're happy with the booziness of the gummies, drain the excess vodka and pat the gummy bears dry with paper towels. Transfer to another container and store in the fridge until ready to use.
 
Prepare the cupcakes as directed and let them cool completely. Frost with your batch of buttercream, decorate as desired and set aside. Fill the champagne glasses with the boozy gummy bears right up until the level that a cupcake will fit. Load the cupcakes into the glasses, being gentle so they sit straight.
 
This **gummy bear recipe** is perfect for customizing your own flavors and colors. I also use this recipe in my breakfast in bed tutorial for realistic looking eggs that are actually gummies! There are so many things you can do with this authentic gummy recipe.
 
**Granulated Sugar** - The main sweetener in this recipe which you probably already have
**Water or flavored liquid like juice** - I like to use water and then use candy flavorings and food coloring for my gummy bears but you can use fruit juice and leave out the granulated sugar for a healthier option.
**Glucose** - Gives the gummy bears that chewy texture and keeps them nice and soft. you can also replace glucose with corn syrup, golden syrup or honey for a more natural option.
**Sorbitol** - The magic ingredient for that perfectly textured gummy bear. You can leave this out if you absolutely do not want to order it but your gummy bears will be little softer in texture.
**Gelatin** - Helps set the gummy bears and gives them a nice chew. You can replace gelatin with agar agar if you would like a vegetarian option but be sure to follow the substitution suggestions on the box.
**Citric Acid** - This is actually really easy to find in grocery stores with the canning supplies. Citric acid is that sour taste from citrus fruits and gives gummy bears that tart flavor.
**Candy Flavoring** - I'm using Lorran oils candy flavoring which can be found at stores that sell candy making supplies like Michaels or Joanns. If you're using juice you can leave this part out.
 
It's also a good idea to have a scale for measuring your ingredients. Using cups is not super accurate so your results may not turn out the same if you try to convert. Read my blog post on how to use a kitchen scale for baking.
 
Combine together your sugar, corn syrup and sorbitol in your saucepan and bring it to a simmer. Then add in your gelatin mixture and stir until it's all melted. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in your citric acid. Let your mixture sit for 5-10 minutes so the foam can rise to the surface.
 
I sprayed my mold with some grapeseed oil first so that the gummies come out nice and shiny and it prevents sticking. Spray the molds then turn them upside down on some paper towels to drain the excess oil out.
 

So, I'm pre-emptively rating this. Regardless of texture or anything, this recipe has returned to me one of the snacks I have been missing for years and years. About five years ago now, I learned that I am allergic to palm and coconut products, both by touch and for eating. This recipe to make my own has returned one of my favorite snacks to me. I'm working on buying all the ingredients, and then I'll be making a batch. Thank you! You get five stars simply for this existing.
 

Excellent recipe! I experimented with fruit juice but found flavour oils far better, both look and taste-wise. I add a pinch more citric acid as I like them quite tart. Surprisingly easy and big wow factor. Highly recommend!

Nutritionally, The Giant 5-Pound Gummy Bear isn't on par with a bag of trail mix. This gummy "snack" may take a few weeks (and the help of a few friends) to polish off because there are fifty-one 120-calorie servings in each bear.
 
Ingredients: Corn syrup, sugar, gelatin (pork source), sorbitol, citric acid, natural and artificial flavors, vegetable oil, carnuba wax, canola oil, lecithin from soybeans, water, rosemary extract. Contains soy.
 
The Giant 5-Pound Gummy Bear (just like the Giant Gummy Bear on a Stick) has a shelf life of approximately one year. What exactly does this mean? Assuming that you keep the bear sealed in its plastic bag and store it at room temperature, it will remain edible for up to a year. You could even store it in the fridge. Between binge
