Restarting my PC was of no help. At least the LED backlighting was working, so it was receiving power. Just no communications. At this point I was becoming really agitated and started to suspect Windows 10 was the cause of my frustrations.
 
Thank you so much! I have a Redragon Vara (Love it!) and it was working on my old machine and i plug it into my new machine (i7 7700k :P) and nothing, nothing happened so i was a little bit stressed but i know it was Windows because it was working before, a google search found me this page and you helped me out, thank you so much!

Press Fn+ macro recording button (it has an icon of a circle in circle) simultanuously and for a few seconds until whole keyboard starts blinking. This resets the keyboard (you will lose your macros). That helped for me.
 
I came here after my son did something to brand new keyboard RedDragon Asura K501.
 The solution above did not work as no NDF-tech or any other non-standard adapter was present on my machines and keyboard was lit but not responding on two different machines with Windows 10, all USB ports.
 
Hi! I tried this and it didnt work ? i have the redragon s102-1. It worked before but then suddenly it stopped working. The ND-tech usb adapter is not showing when i click on the universal. I am so frustrated. I really hate redragon now
 
Hi! i want to do this method but the problem is that i dont see any ND-tech usb adapter under the universal. i only see Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed). My keyboard is k552 anyone can help me? i just bought it.
 
for anyone that may still need help with the keyboard or for the future it could be an even more simple fix than this I bought a K530 and i was confused as it wasnt working but i was being dumb if you plug it in you dont need to have the on switch on as that is for Bluetooth.If you keep it plugged in you dont need the drivers either but if you want to use it bluetooth download the drivers for the right keyboard off the reddragon site

I made it,
 My keyboard stopped working when i download the redragon software and running firmware updater, to solve it i opened the application again and select bootloader option, addicionally i open the main software and it works fine
