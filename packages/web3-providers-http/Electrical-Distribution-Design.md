Ensuring safety and cost-effectiveness in modern vehicles is becoming increasingly difficult. Market demands for performance, sustainability and secure personalized services are prompting automotive industry investments in more complex and electrified solutions. The key challenge for automotive OEMs and suppliers is to guarantee the safety of new generation products that feature advanced automated systems and intricate power distribution architectures.
 
However, the traditional approach to verifying electrical schematic connectivity and analyzing fuse and wire sizing under stress or failure conditions is often a laborious, manual process. This manual approach can be a significant bottleneck, increasing the risk of errors and non-compliance. And this is a serious problem: According to the National Fire Protection Association report released in 2020, most highway vehicle fires were related to electrical distribution design non-compliance issues.
 
If compliance engineering expertise can be used to automatically check designs against defined rules and requirements, EDS engineers would be able to analyze and iterate continuously within the design environment, and ensure their designs are compliant before moving into the prototyping stage. The benefits of this approach include reduced costs, improved quality, lower risk and faster time-to-market.

Once the project moves to the physical design phase, EDS engineers must make sure the fuses protect the wires in worst-case scenarios. Traditionally, fuse selection involves another manual analysis where compliance experts must analyze the wiring current results, review the components specifications and functional requirements, and recommend design changes.
 
With Capital Analysis, all the manual work is eliminated. The solution automates analysis by incorporating design and manufacturer data, conducting stress tests and providing design recommendations, helping users to verify and correct their designs in a much more efficient way.
 
Using Capital Analysis, EDS engineers can dynamically toggle switches to simulate specific scenarios and observe the effects on voltage. Alternatively, they can leverage automation within the tool to identify the worst-case scenarios where voltage drops could impair component function. To do this, users simply specify which parts of the circuit to examine by selecting the appropriate switches, and the Capital Components Sizer processes various scenarios and produces a detailed report highlighting any voltage compliance issues. This helps to pinpoint which components fail under specific conditions and make necessary design adjustments to meet voltage requirements.
 
Capital Analysis enables engineers to continuously analyze, iterate and improve on electrical distribution designs within the Capital Design environment to ensure compliance, and enhance efficiency and accuracy. By enabling early detection and resolution of design issues, the tool empowers engineers to make informed decisions that not only cut costs but enhance product safety.
In a recent webinar, Chenyu She and Vivi Sun, Technical Product Managers at Siemens Digital Industries Software, provide an in-depth discussion and demo of how EDS designers can use Capital Analysis as part of their Capital Design environment to ensure design correctness and compliance early in the design cycle.

As the demand for power intensifies, the need for robust and safe electrical distribution systems in data center environments is paramount. Learn about the critical strategies and technologies essential for enhancing the safety of electrical distribution systems in the face of rising power densities in data centers.
 
To understand the challenges posed by the increasing concentration of electrical power in data center environments, electrical engineers must first know how to design power distribution systems. Then, learn about advancements in electrical distribution that ensure not only operational efficiency but also the highest standards of safety.
 
The electrical distribution system for a college or university campus represents more than just the utility that keeps the lights on. It is the reliable power that supports world class research, the properly sized system that does not fail in the dead of winter or the peak of summer, and the forward-thinking design that allows for seamless integration of growing and evolving campuses. These upgrades are among the most complex and demanding projects that campuses undergo due to the vital nature of this system to every campus building. Although distribution projects require a very high capital investment, the result is manifested as a maintainable, reliable utility, not a single campus building, sports complex, or other asset that one would typically expect from this type of investment.
 
The configuration for an electrical distribution system is the most important decision in the planning process as it directly affects every aspect of how the system is designed. There are three primary types of distribution system configurations: radial, dual radial, and loop. An example of each of the distribution system connection types is shown in Figure No. 1.
 
Radial distribution systems consist of a single electrical feeder to serve individual or multiple buildings loads. The main advantage of utilizing radial feeders is cost. Since only a single feeder is required, smaller ductbanks, less complex service switchgear, and smaller footprint distribution equipment can be used. The disadvantage of radial distribution feeders is the introduction of a single point of failure in the electrical distribution system. Because a single point of failure is the tradeoff for the less costly installation, radial feeders are typically appropriate for non-critical campus buildings or buildings with full generator backup for redundancy.
 
The advantage of dual radial feeders is the ability to source select at each building, but the disadvantage is the inability to isolate individual buildings on the feeders. The advantage of loop feeders is the ability to isolate individual buildings to address problems or perform maintenance, but the disadvantage is the inability to source select on an individual building basis. Although both dual radial and loop feeders can be routed in geographically diverse paths to increase system reliability, loop feeders more easily lend themselves to do so. Dual radial and loop feeders are more reliable for campus distribution and typically serve critical buildings or buildings where outages are difficult to coordinate.
 
This report gives the engineer guidelines for designing a high-quality underground distribution (UD) system. Before starting a design, the engineer must have comprehensive knowledge of the components of a UD system. Next, the engineer must understand how these components can be configured to form different types of UD systems and the special design concerns of each.
 
The use of underground distribution by electric co-ops continues to grow. The NRECA Strategic Analysis Department has determined that the percentage of co-op-owned distribution lines that are underground has more than tripled in 27 years from 5% in 1980 to 16% in 2007. In addition, the number of co-ops that have at least 50 miles of underground distribution has increased from 58% in 1995 to 79% as of 2007. Underground distribution will continue to rise as a percentage of total co-op distribution lines due to the strong preference for it in many rapidly growing suburban co-ops.
 
This 400+ page guide provides a step-by-step methodical approach to designing an underground distribution system. From selecting the cable to designing the conduit system, readers will be walked through each step of the design process.
