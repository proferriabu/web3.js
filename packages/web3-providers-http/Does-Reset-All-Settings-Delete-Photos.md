No, you will only reset all the settings back to their defaults your pictures will not be deleted. You can just take the SD card out too before you reset if you want and your pictures will no longer be in the camera.
 
No, but it's not a good idea to be in a position where you have to ask the question. After you've finished a shoot, you should copy your pictures to one or more disk drives as soon as possible. Then you won't have to worry about losing them.

When I did DSLR 101 classes you would be amazed at how many Moms especially would have hundreds or even thousands of photos on their cameras. They typically us the largest SD card possible and load it up!
 
I think it is just one more thing Canon missed out on. Because these young Moms are cell phone users, They tend to treat their cameras like they use their iphones. Canon avoided all attempts to make the consumer camera line work more like a cell phone and now that market has vanished.
 
During the time that Canon has been making digital cameras, there has been a significant evolution in cell phone protocols. I think I can forgive Canon for not wanting to pry open that can of worms. Besides, it's just as bad an idea to leave all your pictures on your phone as it is to leave them on your camera.
 
Your or my concept of it being a bad idea or not is insignificant if it is what people do or how they want to do it. It is Canon's job, or Apple's job, to make that happen. Companies need to respond to consumers needs and wants. Canon didn't in the P^S market and look where it is now. Canon has resisted in the low end consumer market, too. Maybe they can't, I don't know but people are going to do things the way they want to. Young people like cell phones, they know no different. They like having thousands of photos right there in their hands.

Many common iOS-related issues have reset all settings on iDevices as one of the major fixes. So, if your iPhone encounters an error and only thing left for you to fix the error is to reset all settings, then it's good to know what it really means before proceeding. Indeed, you would be definitely curious about what happens when I reset my iPhone. Isn't it right? In this post, we're going to cover all you need to know about resetting all settings on the iPhone.
 
If you choose the "Reset All Settings" option on your iPhone, then it will reset all of your settings to their default but will keep your apps and personal data. Those settings include network settings, the Home screen layout, the keyboard dictionary, privacy settings, location settings, and Apple Pay cards - are reset or removed to their defaults.
 
There can be several reasons for this action, but the primary one is to fix bugs, malware, or errors that won't leave you alone. While there are other ways to troubleshoot common problems on iPhone, sometimes, reset is the only option left. With reset all settings, you will be able to return your device's settings to their default without wiping erasing your data.
 
With reset all settings, it will wipe out all settings except your personal data. You will lose all Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other network settings, screen settings such as dark mode, sound settings, system settings, home screen arrangement, and so on. Your personal data like email accounts, files, phones, etc won't be affected.
 
With erase all content and settings, on the other hand, wipe out all settings along with your personal data as well. Everything will turn back to the way it was when you first purchased your iPhone. This option comes in handy when you want to sell your device to someone else.
 
People need to use "Reset All Settings" usually after encountering a problem with their iPhone, such as errors, stuck on Apple logo, black screen, etc. In some cases, simply resetting all settings can get rid of these problems. In other cases, "Reset All Settings" isn't enough. Instead of erasing all contents and settings which will erase data, we recommend you to give UltFone iOS System Repair a try.
 
So, does reset all settings delete photos and videos on your iPhone? Now, you probably know the answer to this question. Isn't it right? When it comes to fixing common issues encountered on the iPhone, using reset all settings option comes in handy as it doesn't lead to data loss. But, sometimes, fixing some errors requires an advanced solution, and that's when the UltFone iOS System Repair role comes in.
 
I am looking to select about 1,000 photos, all of which have edits, flags, ratings, and colors. I will be putting them into a new collection and I want to start over from scratch with these 1,000 photos. I have tried to select all of the photos in Develop Mode and "Clear History" but that doesn't do it.
 
Highlight all of the images, turn on auto-sync, and click on the reset button. That will reset all images to the default setting that was applied when the images were imported. With all of the images still selected, press 0 to remove all Star ratings. Then you will have to go to the menu to choose "None" to remove all color labels.
 
Are you running Lightroom Classic (the traditional desktop-focused program) or Lightroom (the cloud-focused app)? Lightroom Classic's icon is "LrC" while Lightroom's icon is "Lr" -- or do the menu command Help > System Info and look at the first line.
 
My apologies. I realized after posting that it was Lightroom instead of Lightroom Classic. I didn't know there were two versions. Is it not possible to do the batch reset in Lightroom? Thank you for your help!
 
Thank Adobe marketers for the confusing naming. Best to post your query in the Lightroom Cloud forum, where you'll get better answers (and others with the same question will find those answers in the future):
 

There IS NO 'History' in Lightroom! But there seems to be a similar function called 'Version' instead, which I appreciate because you can save a version you may wanna go back to later or it automatically saves different versions for you. That's nice,
 
Rob, have you tested that process with images that have Masks added? In my testing, when using this procedure to reset multiple images back to the original unedited state, it fails to reset any Masks that may have been applied to any of the target images. All other settings are correctly reset, just not the Masks. It would be useful to have confirmation of that.
 
Trying the "create a Reset preset" method from a fully reset image doesn't work either, as there'll be no option to include "Masking" in the preset (unless the image already has a Mask applied, in which case the preset would ADD the Mask to the target images).
 
In fact, if the images to be reset contain Masks, the only way I can see to reset them completely is using the Reset Edits option one by one ("Reset Edits" in the Photo Menu when multiple images are selected is greyed out, so isn't an option).
 
Rob, it's been confirmed by Adobe in another thread ( -ecosystem-cloud-based-discussions/apply-preset-to-multiple-...) that there is no Batch Reset function in Lightroom Desktop yet. Furthermore, the preset idea won't work when masks are involved (but will work for other edits) because it's impossible to fashion a preset that would reset existing masks.
 
A factory reset restores a computer, smartphone, etc., back to the state it was in when it left the factory. This includes deleting all the data, apps, and settings the user changed on the device. The next person to use it should have the same experience as when it was first unboxed.
 
Depending on the electrical gadget, factory resets can be accomplished in a variety of methods. In certain cases, this can be accomplished by accessing the device's Service Menu. Other gadgets may need complete software reinstallation. The following sections will explain the importance of a factory reset and detail how to restore factory settings to various common devices.
 
A factory reset is a process that clears all data and settings from a device and returns it to its default settings, meaning that the device is reset to the point where it is in the same state it was in when it was first taken out of the box.
 
Factory reset means that you restore a device to its original system state by erasing all of the information stored on the device in an attempt to restore the device's software to its original manufacturer settings.
 
Factory resetting the device to its original state helps solve any software or configuration issues, allowing it to function normally again. This can include fixing issues with software updates, fixing errors in the operating system, and improving overall performance.
 
Some types of data might not be fully erased during a factory reset, and could theoretically be recovered using specialized software. This is particularly a concern for highly sensitive data. To completely eliminate data, the device's storage would need to be securely wiped or physically destroyed.
 
However, it's crucial to remember that not all malware and viruses can be eliminated with a factory reset. Furthermore, even after a device has been reset to factory settings, some viruses can persist, especially if they have been well embedded into the firmware or operating system; seeking professional assistance in such cases is necessary.
 
For an organization wanting to maximize the impact of its IT budget, loaner devices are a logical choice. Allowing employees to check out devices as needed prevents waste if they are only using them sporadically, if at all.
 
However, shared corporate devices create the potential for employees to have unnecessary and unauthorized access to corporate data stored on them. Performing a factory reset of devices between owners helps to prevent these accidental data leaks.
