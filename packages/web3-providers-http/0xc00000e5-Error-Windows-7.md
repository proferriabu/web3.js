Thank you forreaching out on the community and telling us about your issue. I do apologize for the issue you're having. I was taking a look to see what could be causing this error and noticed that it was a windows error rather than a quicken one. That being said I did notice that quite a few posts on Microsoft message boards have said that this could be a problem with an antivirus blocking the program from opening. If you do have an antivirus I would check to see if quicken is allowed to open from the antivirus settings. You could also try turning it off and seeing if then you're able to.

However on the forum in the link I also had the netwtw10 error as well because the older driver I had installed would throw that up instead of the netwtw12 in the event viewer. If I use the latest driver on either the motherboard manufacturer or on the intel website it will not fix the issue even on a clean install of windows 11 it still seems to have the same problem.
 
AC Wifi 5 Router does not have any settings to run on AX, only Wifi 6 and 6E wifi routers have that setting, further AC routers can connect 80 MHZ max. Wifi 6 160 MHz is native,, 211AX wifi 6E has 3 bands and runs best on 6Ghz band and for that need a 6E wifi router and may be able to squeeze by with Wifi 6 router.
 
My router supports 160Mhz channel width. Also the Wi-Fi adapter is backwards compatible with older connection types such as ac,n so there should be no issue with connections. Also when I google max channel width for ac it has 160Mhz as the max.
 
Hi SpaceChrome, I've been having the same problems and may have found a partial fix. My motherboard is a Z790-P Wifi 6E, also has the AX211, and comes with two attachable wifi antennas. Out of curiosity and stupidity, I decided to remove one of the antennas (although I could never recommend doing this), and that somehow has fixed the stability issues.
 
Thanks for your patience. Based on the investigation, I recommend you try the latest driver version 22.230.0 and if the issue persists with this driver, you must check with MSI since the wireless card may need to be replaced.
 
Intel AX211 is a tri-band wifi card with preference to 6 Ghz band @160Mhz . Its trying to handshake at 6 Ghz connection speed. Buy a wifi 6E router and problem solved, a very very few AX211 cards run well on Wifi 5 not only is Wifi 5 limited to 80 Mhz, there many many more features that Wifi 5 is missing and that a Wifi 6E card is expecting and trying to load the drivers for. You have a high end wifi card why not a matching wifi router ?

To fix the Windows 0xc00000e5 error, check that your antivirus isn't preventing apps from opening. You can also run problem apps as an administrator, repair corrupt files with SFC, and scan for bad disk sectors with Check Disk.
 
Windows error 0xc00000e5 is one of the more common error codes users report seeing. The error code usually includes a message such as "The application was unable to start correctly," which gives you a rough idea of the cause but doesn't offer a solution. Luckily, we can help.
 
Error code 0xc00000e5 denotes a problem with one or more applications. Generally, it means that the application was unable to open correctly, either when requested by the user or automatically during startup.
 
The error is commonly caused by your antivirus software flagging the app as suspicious, either correctly or incorrectly. It can also sometimes occur when an app can't access required system files due to them being either missing or corrupted.
 
Whatever the cause, this error can be very frustrating, particularly if it appears without warning and prevents you from getting things done. Thankfully, the 0xc00000e5 error isn't usually difficult to fix if you know the most common triggers.
 
Both Microsoft Defender and third-party antivirus services, particularly Comodo and AVG, are known to cause Windows error 0xc00000e5. If you experience this error shortly after installing or updating antivirus software, this is likely the problem.
 
Run a full virus scan, which will hopefully tell you that the error is not caused by malware on your computer. If the scan finds malware, remove or quarantine it. When you are sure your system is clear of viruses, try opening the app to check if this was the cause of the error.
 
If the error persists, try adding the problem app to the antivirus exception list (known as Exclusions in Microsoft Defender.) If you experience the error with multiple apps, adding them all to the exception list can be arduous. It may be easier to disable your antivirus software temporarily before checking the apps.
 
Assuming your antivirus wasn't the cause of the error, the next most likely candidate is the app being unable to access required system files. That could be because the app doesn't have the required privileges.
 
You can test this by running the app as an administrator. You can do this by right-clicking the EXE file for the app and selecting "Run as Administrator" from the context menu. Click "Yes" in the UAC confirmation window.
 
If that fixes the problem, but you don't want to repeat the process each time you open the app, you can set it to always run as administrator. To do this, right-click the EXE file for the app and select Properties > Compatibility. Check the box next to "Run this Program as an Administrator," then click "Apply."
 
In Command Prompt, type "SFC /scannow" and press "Enter." When the SFC scan finishes, you will see a message telling you if corrupt files were found and fixed. If nothing was found or the corrupted files could not be repaired, you'll see a message appropriate to each outcome.
 
A Check Disk scan can still be helpful, even if corrupt files were found and repaired in SFC. While still in Command Prompt, type "chkdsk /r c:" and press "Enter" to start the disk scan. You can scan different drives by replacing "c:" with the appropriate drive letter.
 
By the time you reach this step, the 0xc00000e5 application error should be fixed. But making sure you keep Windows updated and all of the latest security patches applied could help you avoid similar errors in the future.
 
Despite being frustrating to encounter, Windows error codes are a useful diagnostic tool. They are usually quite specific, making it easier to search for ways to fix the problem. Here are some other common Windows error codes.
 
I downloaded Malwarebytes and Emsisoft yesterday to correct a malware problem I was having in Chrome. That problem has been corrected. I also have ZoneAlarms free version of firewall and antivirus. Today I am getting this error:
 
I have already tried changing the value of AppInit\_Dlls to 1 at this location: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit\_Dlls and at WOW6432node location, These had no effect. I have also been able to run windows update which did not correct the error. I have tried to remove Emsisoft and Malwarbytes but I am unable to remove either of them. I have also tried to restore Windows to a date prior to installing these programs and I is unable to complete.
 
I am getting this error constantly while playing. It has made it impossible to play on my unit and I have run out of ideas on how to fix it. It occurs both with and without mods and it is not consistent. Sometimes I can play for 3 hours, other times only 3 minutes. I have tried the solutions suggested 
at both =898170227 and \_3:\_Unusual\_process\_exit#0xC0000005\_-\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION, but neither have helped. I have also tested my hardware components and ran stability tests and nothing seems to be the problem on the hardware side. Does anyone have any ideas what is actually causing this to happen? Does anyone know of any other fixes to try?
 
A: It may have always happened, I honestly can't remember, but it has certainly always happened on this machine I built last summer. I have put up with it for a while since it's not a big deal if it only happens every hour or so when playing King of the Hill, but when I'm doing ops with a group it is a real bummer.
 
A: Both. There have been times where it crashes during intense urban fighting with a lot of AI or a ton of explosions, but it has also just randomly crashed when it is just me standing in a field by myself.
 
I feel these answers don't seem to help narrow any
