The publishing firm Estes and Lauriat was a joint venture between Charles Lauriat (1842-1920), a Bostonian who had apprenticed with a bookseller and continued working in book sales for the first part of his career, and Dana Estes (1840-1909), who had been working in publishing. At first, they called the company Estes and Lauriat Bookselling, Publishing, and Importing, but in 1876 they abbreviated it simply to Estes and Lauriat Publishing. Their partnership lasted until 1898.[1]

In 1858, the association governing the New-York Gallery of the Fine Arts was dissolved, and their collection was transferred to the New-York Historical Society.

For any procedures for one or more agencies adopted under paragraph (1)(A), the Attorney General, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall ensure that the procedures enable the vetting of all non-United States persons who are being processed for travel to the United States using terms that do not qualify as United States person query terms under this chapter.
