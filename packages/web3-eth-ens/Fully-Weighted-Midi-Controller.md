Something interesting caught my eye while shopping for popular keyboards to try...

it was an odd looking find deep in the Amazon search listings...

advertising a 'fully-weighted 88 key Midi controller'

for only $250....

from a brand I'd never heard of.

Was this the greatest hidden gem find of all time...

or was it too good to be true?

Well, we ordered one to find out in this review of the Cheapest Fully-Weighted Keyboard on Amazon.

The results were... interesting to say the least.

**MIDI controllers** are among the most essential pieces of equipment in any studio environment. MIDIs come in different shapes and sizes, each offering a unique functionality. With all the options available on the market, choosing the right one can be difficult. `e piano-like key beds. While some models tweak the key shape, weight, and size for various purposes, some manufacturers put **full-size hammer-action keys** that mimic the keys on a piano.
 
**Native Instruments** is one of the most renowned hardware and software developers in the music scene. Its flagship MIDI keyboard, the **Komplete Kontrol S88**, has recently been updated, featuring a more minimalistic design language.
 
The Komplete Kontrol S88 Mk3 comes with**88 fully-weighted hammer-action keys** made by the Italian company Fatar. The keybed feels impressively similar to a real piano. Moreover, the aluminum frame and metal knobs make the whole device feel premium and sturdy.
 
Besides the keybed, this MIDI controller sports **eight rotary knobs** and a bunch of buttons to control different parameters and navigate through different menus. Updated for the Mk3, the Komplete Kontrol S88 sports a**large color screen** that makes controlling your daw and built-in settings more straightforward. The **onboard processor** makes MIDI programming and using other features much easier.

One of the defining features of the Komplete Kontrol series is the LED light strip placed on top of the keybed. Besides the cool factor, these lights can be programmed to turn on based on different scales as a guide.
 
The **Roland A-88 MKII** is another excellent full-size MIDI controller with **graded hammer-action keys**. Despite featuring a considerably compact and portable design, the A-88 MKII packs a decent amount of controls for manipulating different parameters and DAW control, including eight rotary knobs. Moreover.
 
Moreover, this keyboard features a ton of knobs and buttons to control different parameters, making it an excellent all-in-one package for music producers. The Impact LX88+ features nine faders, eight rotary knobs, eight velocity-sensitive pads, and a handful of buttons for DAW control.
 
With all of those features coming at a fraction of the cost of most other 88-key MIDIs, the Nektar Impact LX88+ is one of the best MIDI controllers for beginners or musicians on a tight budget. You can get one on Amazon for only $320.
 
When working primarily with piano sounds, I need a realistic keyboard action with fully weighted keys. When working with various sounds, including strings, organs, synths, etc., semi-weighted keys often provide a better balance.
 
I have to be honest; the Hammer 88 Pro was my top pick until I bought a Studiologic Numa X Piano GT. Since then, nothing feels better to me than a Studiologic/Fatar keyboard, and the SL88 is no different.
 
The KeyLab Essential 88 Mk3 has semi-weighted keys with a waterfall-style action. Waterfall keyboards are ideal for synths and organs but still perform relatively well when using acoustic piano sounds.
 
The software bundle is so impressive for two reasons: first, Analog Lab (over 2000 presets) sounds amazing, and second, the controls auto-map to every preset, making presets almost feel like a physical instrument.
 
The S88 Mk3 comes with an impressive software bundle, including Kontakt 7, Komplete Select 14, and one of my personal favorites, Stradivari Cello. It also features chord/scale modes and an arpeggiator.
 
I've recently purchased Kontakt 5, and I'm exited to start using it, but I'm thinking that my current MIDI controller (an 88 weighted key digital piano) will probably be difficult to play on for non-piano instruments. So, I'm in the market for a MIDI controller, and I'm surprised by the lack of affordable options out there. Here's what I'm looking for:
 
After quite a bit of Googling, the only things I can find that fit the bill are some vintage synths (Yamaha SY99, Kurzweil MIDIboard, GEM S3, Ensoniq TS-10) that are incredibly expensive on the second hand market because of their old school sound and scarcity.
 
Unfortunately, pure-controller keyboards often have low-quality keybeds. The good news is that there are a lot of great synths with good keybeds on the used market. Just look for the high-end synths of yesterday that have since fallen out of fashion.
 
Instead of a SY99, look for the Yamaha EX5. The SY99 is Yamaha's best FM-engine keyboard, so that's why it commands a premium. The EX5 was a flop, and has a fairly limited (but dedicated) fanbase. I paid less than USD$500 for mine, though they can go for as much as $600. (More recently, I picked up a TG77, which is most of the synth engine from the SY99 in rackmount form. Only missing a few minor things which I can make up for with other gear)
 
Polyphonic aftertouch is incredibly rare. The VAX77 is just about your only choice for a new poly-AT keyboard. If you are open to something less conventional. Madrona Labs' Soundplane is much less expensive, but not at all a conventional keyboard. As far as I can tell, poly-AT has been a market failure because the inexpensive technologies for producing them are covered by patents and because few keyboardists have mastered the ability to modulate the pressure of individual fingers. Interestingly, Roland has eliminated channel aftertouch from their flagship piano-rompler, the RD-700NX. You have to go back to the RD-700GFX to get aftertouch at all. But then you'd have a fully-weighted keyboard that is probably well outside your budget.
 
Update: One more thing to consider is that many of the Kontakt libraries are limited to the actual performance range of the sampled instrument. Unless you are playing grand pianos, you will rarely need more than 61 keys. So you could grab an old Yamaha S80 or S90 for your piano needs, and some random 61-key keyboard for everything else.
 
They are very basic pieces of equipment with all the essentials: aftertouch, of course, pitch bend, mod wheel, and volume control. Pedal inputs for sustain and expression. MIDI out and MIDI over USB. No tone module; it's a straight controller.
 
If you must have something completely unweighted, you are likely going to have to go down to 61-key territory. **The reason for this is that no one really uses 88-key unweighted controllers--if they're going with that large of a keyboard, the only reason is that they're going to be playing piano music, and thus the extra weight will be welcome. Synth or organ playing that makes more sense with unweighted keys doesn't need more than 61.**
 
I also have the SL MkII 61 as my main controller (I also have a Clavinova fully weighted piano). I did have the replace my first one as the power switch was faulty but the second has had no issues at all.
 
novation controllers are pretty good in use, but automap 4??? possibly the worst piece of software every written. most problematic ive ever seen and yet its pretty essential to get the most from those controllers.
i know of dozens of people who regret trying to even get automap to work.
 
Pianos... weighted (aka fully weighted or hammer action) is almost always best, semi-weighted action (which is basically an unweighted action with weight added) next, and unweighted generally worst. There's still a god deal of variation within each of those categories.
 
Maybe this is the best place for a shameless plug! Our now not-so-new new video at is a 40 minute adaptation of T. S. Eliot's "Prufrock" - check it out! And hopefully I'll have something new here this year. ;-)
 
Weighted for any sort of piano, acoustic or electric, synth style for, well, synths. Considering organ is not touch sensitive, it works well on synth although organ keys do have a slight resistance/spring perhaps best simulated by a semi weighted keybed.
 
I've very surprisingly gotten used to playing everything live on a Nord stage 3 compact, though at home I play piano on a weighted keyboard. We don't play a lot of subtle piano stuff though we do have a few ballads and such (and songs like Seger's Main Street). I wasn't intending to gig this alone, and never thought I'd get on with playing that keybed this much.

Best all-rounder I prefer a quality synth action, the TP9 from Fatar I always liked. This is not great for organ though, for that if you can't get waterfall, then a really light shallow action like that on the Modx7--which I dislike for everything else!--works fine.

I'll get used to most things in a few weeks. No doubt that a nice-to-play action can make you want to play though.
 
I have two main keyboards right now, the MODX+ and the MONTAGE 6. Due to weight, I end taking the formerly only-rehearsals MODX6+ to some gigs. And there is a huge difference on its keybed and the FSX of the MONTAGE. I do some piano intros and, well, the MODX6+ is a PITA for that ?
 
This forum taught me that there's basically no difference between unweighted/semi-weighted/synth actions. They all rely on springs to return the key to its starting point. (a "semi-weighted" may have additional weights under the keys compared to an "unweighted" from the same manufacturer, but there are no external rules regulating this). There are decent sprung actions (Kronos, Montage, Fantom) and crappy sprung actions (Krome, VR0
