Other books that have been read often this week are Kissed by the Moon (Alison Lester), and Where is the Green Sheep (Mem Fox and Judy Horacek). The former was for S from the Christmas Eve Book Fairy. It was one I borrowed from the local library when C was a baby and I love it. I have read it a few times with all girls around me this week and that is possibly one of my highlights. A beautiful wish for my babies. The latter had been hiding under a sofa for a time so its rediscovery has been a joy. Every pair of sheep brings smiles. Every reading brings smiles.
 
Thanks - I am trying to make this for my baby on the way. I'm a beginner, so I'm not exactly sure what you mean by 'the back loop of each dc'? Could you maybe post a pic?! I think the blanket is beautiful.
 
Thank you for posting this pattern. I just finished a pink one using Pound of Love acrylic yarn as that's what I had on hand. I've purchased some cotton for the next one. I love that it is so simple, yet so pretty! If you want to see my version, check my blog www.seamswell.blogspot.com
 
I just finished this using Peaches and Creme yarn on the cone in Billowing Blue. I'm making two more blankets, one in Peaches and Creme Pageantry and the other in Red Heard Super Saver Perfect Pink. Thank you for a beautiful and easy pattern!

melissa,
for some reason i cannot leave a comment on your blog. (i couldn't comment on my own blog until i changed the comment settings.) so i hope you find this...

the part where you wrote,"i'm actually very excited that she'd going to school because i never thought she would be able to go to school" touched my mother heart so very deeply.
 
Hi...thanks for sharing this beautiful pattern. I am having trouble with the border though. I am doing fine, until I get to the sides of the blanket. How do we go down the sides? Thanks in advance for any help on this. YarnySongs :)
 
colleen,

when you turn the work, keep working in the farthest loop from you. i'm glad you asked!


yarnysongs,

it's easier to make the border on the top and bottom ends because the chains from the previous rows are visible. the sides are a bit different, however. there are no visible stitches, right? 

i hope i can make this clear in writing...

going down the sides i continue by making 3 chains and 2 double crochets. when i get to the slip stitch that anchors to the main body, i sort of lay the shell/scallop down and join it where it falls. it should be about the length of your double crochets. 

i hope this helps. let me know if you have more questions.
 
I just finished this pattern! I did it with three strands of multi-colored yarn, held together....it looks beautiful, and so cushy! I'm new to crochet (taught myself about 2 weeks ago) and this was perfect! Way faster than knitting - which I've been doing for years!
 
I found the pattern on Ravelry and followed it over here. What a beautiful baby blanket! I just so happen to have 3 cones of ecru Sugar n Cream cotton yarn :) I am going to make this for my nephew and his wife - they are expecting their first baby in April. I think this beautiful blanket will be a wonderful heirloom. Thank you so much for the pattern!
 
Thank you so much for this pattern! My oldest friend was expecting her first baby and I couldn't be there so I wanted to make something really special, but I just learned to crochet more than a chain stitch about 2 months ago :-) so I wanted something that wouldn't be too difficult. I especially wanted a blanket that didn't have lots of holes that little toes could get caught in. I just finished your pattern and it was perfect! I can't wait to send it to her. I will definitely be making this for more friends' babies in the future! :-)
Here is what mine looks like -baby-blanket
 
Hi, I'm working on this blanket for my daughter! I decided to make it a little longer, though, and have added more rows. Does it need to be a specific multiple of a number in order for the shell border to fit? Hope this makes sense, I'm rather inexperienced and don't know all the correct terms. Thanks!
 
I'm a little confused about the shell border. The first part...(\*Ch 3 (counts as first dc), dc in same sp, 2 times. Sk next 2 sts, sl st in next st;) makes sense to me. However, the next part (continue from \* around the entire main body. Join with a sl st at the beginning ch 3.) does not. Could you maybe clarify this section a little bit for me? Thanks
 
Thank you so much for posting this. I am knitting one for my hope chest, and I will do one for my friends granddaughter once they know the sex (or I'll go with a neutral color). 

Love how easy it is, but it looks really nice.
 
FennellFanClub,

do the part that makes sense to you starting with the \* over and over again all the way around the double crochet "square" blanket. when you get to where you started, join with a slip stitch and weave in the ends. 

i hope that makes sense.
