Urbanization and economic development have traditionally gone hand in hand as cities foster ideas, skills, and economies of scale. However, on the downside, rapid urban growth can cause congestion effects; for instance, by increasing exposure to natural hazards and pressure on public services and infrastructure.

This is particularly relevant for cities that lack the capacity for risk-informed urban planning and the financial resources to invest in transport and protection infrastructure. And as safe spaces in urban areas become increasingly occupied and land becomes scarce, new developments are built disproportionally on previously avoided areas such as riverbeds, flood plains, or wetlands .
 
Our study offers a systematic and global analysis of spatial urbanization patterns and their evolving exposure to 1-in-100 year flood hazards. It uses high-resolution global flood hazard maps by Fathom and JRC, as well as the World Settlement Footprint Evolution (WSF-Evo) data set, which offers high precision measurements of human settlements from 1985 to 2015 at 30 by 30 meters spatial resolution and with global coverage.

In an age of increasing disaster losses due to flood events, effective flood risk mitigation efforts must be based on a robust understanding of the different contributing factors to flood risk . These can include intensifying hazards (e.g., due to climate change), increasing exposure to hazards (due to expanding at-risk settlements), and rising vulnerability to shocks (e.g., due to inadequate building standards or social protection systems). Using data with high spatio-temporal resolution, our study shows that rising exposure to flood hazards is key to understanding the global rise in flood disaster losses.
 
These findings have concrete implications for urban planners and policymakers. In areas, where flood exposure is already high, investments in disaster preparedness and protection are crucial to mitigate losses (early warning systems, social protection, and protective infrastructure, for example). In areas where flood exposure is still low but rapidly increasing, revision of land use and urbanization plans are urgent priorities to avoid the highest-risk areas. While land scarcity and geographic constraints can mean that flood zones cannot always be avoided, careful planning of flood protection systems and disaster preparedness measures can support resilient socio-economic development .
 
Since then, Eyes on the Forest has been investigating loss of forests and deforestation drivers on the ground in Indonesia's top deforestation province, Riau, and the adjacent Jambi province, while analyzing deforestation island-wide through remote sensing. Our own satellite image analysis found that Sumatra's 44 million hectare mainland, covered by 25 million ha (57%) of natural forests in 1985, lost 56% of this forest over 31 years and only 11 million ha (25%) remained in 2016. Sumatra lost forest at an average rate of 0.46 million hectares per year (1.8%) (go to EoF interactive map on Deforestation Drivers for more information).
 
Deforestation has been facilitated by lack of governance and happened often through land grabbing in disregard of tenurial rights. The massive land clearing for development of their plantations and harvesting of natural forest wood is measurably contributing to climate change through emission of forest and peat carbon. The habitats of Sumatran tigers, elephants, rhinos and orangutans are heavily disturbed and have been reduced so much that the populations have declined significantly.
 
In 2016, KKI Warsi joined the coalition to monitor deforestation in Bukit Tigapuluh, a forest landscape stretching from Riau into Jambi province. Eyes on the Forest and KKI Warsi have collaborated for Bukit Tigapuluh conservation in the past and published joint report in 2010. EoF field investigators are constantly on the road, endlessly riding through degraded landscapes to the frontiers of deforestation or following pulpwood and palm fruit to their final destinations, the mills and refineries that process them (go to EoF interactive map for 1. Pulp & paper and 2. Palm oil investigation findings).
 
After many decades of commodity driven deforestation, key deforestation drivers including Sinar Mas Group's Golden Agri-Resources and Asia Pulp & Paper, Royal Golden Eagle's APRIL and Asian Agri, Wilmar and Musim Mas have recently committed to zero deforestation. Their commitments came too late for Sumatra's forests and high conservation values including the eight forest blocks like Bukit Tigapuluh and Tesso Nilo (for example, read this EoF report on APP and EoF report on illegal palm oil trade). Eyes on the Forest keeps pressuring and monitoring these companies to implement their commitments, not only to stop causing deforestation through their supply chains, but also to start conserving and restoring high conservation value areas to remedy its legacy of deforestation.

The history of politics in Indonesia, especially Orde Baru is indeed inseparable from the conflict between Islam and the state, especially the problem of ideology. This was seen when the Orde Baru applied a non-aspirational political strategy to Islam, one of them is asas tunggal Pancasila. The inequality of political views with the government caused various reactions and resistance from radical Islamists. One of the incidents is the Borobudur Temple bombing in 1985. The methods used in this study were historical research methods, this is: (1) Heuristics, (2) Source Criticism, (3) Interpretation, and (4) Historiography. The results of this study indicate that there are factors underlying the occurrence of the Borobudur Temple bombing, this is: (1) Political factors, the reactions of various Orde Baru policies which were considered to marginalize Islam, (2) Social factors, the emergence of a sense of injustice conducted by the government in the Tanjung Priok tragedy 1984, (3) Religious and ideological emotional factors, the desire to carry out a revolution like in Iran by revenge for bombing. The handling of the government in this case took two months, until the incident of Pemudi Express Bus exploded which resulted in the arrest of the perpetrators. This bombing resulted in the destruction of nine Borobudur Temple stupas which led to the restoration and improvement of the temple area security system. This incident also had an impact on the tourism, social and political economy in Indonesia.
 
A forthcoming report from the International Food Policy Research Institute analyzes protection to the agricultural sector in India, Indonesia, China and Vietnam. The study calculates commodity-specific market-price support (MPS) and producer support estimates (PSEs) for each country.

According to an abstract of the as-yet unpublished study, governments in all four countries relaxed their grip on agriculture during the 1985-2002 period, moving from state-led policies that aimed to keep food prices low and promote food self-sufficiency, to greater integration with the world market.

The study looks at 11 commodities in India, and finds agricultural support rose in response to low world prices and dipped when world prices were high. Input subsidies have risen in India in the period 1985-2002.

Analysis on China is limited to the 1995-2001 period, over which its agricultural policies were almost neutral: "neither protection or disprotection."

Vietnam, like China, opened up its economy in the 1990s, "and there has been a shift from an import-substitution strategy toward export promotion, with decreasing disprotection turning to positive protection overall."

Indonesia has subsidized agriculture since the 1990s, and provides the most consistent support, particularly to food crops. While support was interrupted during the Asian financial crisis (1997-98), it soon returned to pre-crisis levels and then increased in the early parts of 2000.
