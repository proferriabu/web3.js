I work with CNC milling, routing, lasercutting, 3D printing etc, and definitely have to bounce back to between illustrator bc of the pen tool and some other things in creating offsets that Illustrator handles differently.

Adobe Illustrator was developed in a era when books and manuals were used as a means of copy protection. Back then, making a user interface intuitive was a conflict of interest. If so many people wanted to use Adobe Illustrator wrongly that they coded warnings and recommendations for the user, then it was Adobe that was wrong about the user interface decisions they made.
 
I am back two years later to readdress the need for a tool like the Pen Tool in Illustrator. I am currently learning Fusion 360, and the line tool in that program is crude compared to the array of curve tools in Rhino3D. The developers in their forums will not listen, so I will again try my luck here. Anyhow, I understand that you can make any sort of line segment in Rhino, and the tangent, blend, arc, interpolate, etc are all incredible tools, but your handle curve tool can not compare and does not compare to Illustrator pen tool, Affinity designer pen tool, Inkscape pen tool, etc. the problem is the starting and stopping is incredibly inefficient in Rhino. It is such a nightmare trying to get geometry back and forth between Rhino and any of the 2D programs so it would be so much better to be able to quickly and efficiently draw organic, complex closed shapes with straight and curved lines directly in Rhino3D. Rhino is the best program ever for most things, but this is a massive hang up and seems like such an easy fix. I know some of you long time Rhino users have tried learning a different 3D program and been disappointed that a certain aspect was much worse than Rhino ( command line, snapping, gumball, arrays, etc). Open yourself to the possibility that another tool from another program might be more efficient and intuitive, and might improve Rhino. I have attached some linework examples of things that are inordinately time consuming to do in Rhino with the current curve tools. I work as a CNC programmer and operator for a furniture shop, and as a college instructor for Rhino3D, Illustrator, Photoshop and for Digital Fabrication specializing in CNC, 3D printing and laser
cutting.

As someone who often has to work with graphics other people create in Illustrator, God no a thousand times no. Illustrator curves are usually garbage that have to be redrawn in Rhino to be fit for purpose. Rhino is made for cutting steel, Illustrator-style curves are not. It would be unleashing a nightmare of support calls and frustrated machinists.
 
I'm having this problem with my Adobe Illustrator CS3 where I'll be using the pen tool, and out of nowhere (usually after I've undone a couple of things it seems), the program will get stuck on the hand tool, and won't switch to any other tool. Time seems to be the only remedy because the problem will persist even if I try to work on another file, or restart the program. It also carries over to Photoshop, which I don't recall ever giving me this problem. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

I've found that having google chrome or safari open can cause random glitches in Adobe programmes. Quit any search engine you may be using and see if the glitch goes away, if not, quit the adobe programme that you are using and restart. It should now be back to normal when booted back up.
 
It's not the spacebar. I wish it were that easy. I'm having the same problem in Illustrator and InDesign. It started after the Windows 10 update, but I don't know if its the Windows update or the recent Adobe update.
 
Don't think it is a spacebar problem. Look at -stuck-on-hand-toolicon/ for shared concern with many people. I have been encountering this on just about all tool-related programs -Illustrator CS4, Painter 11, Photoshop CS2. Every time the problem clears in a few minutes. I have XP Pro, 3 GB of RAM, Duo Core 2.40GHz - no memory issues. I suspect the problem is software related in how it is using computer resources - possible conflict with some Microsoft performance addition.
 
That might or mght not be an issue you are having but i have to say taking the approach orf selective choosintgg the answers will not solve your problem if Scott is correct then all the time you spend looking for your perfect software solution will be very costly.
 
3) Also, while the keyboard notion is a good thought, I'm thinking that we can't all have keyboard issues. My keyboard is almost new and every key works beautifully. Here is a filtered forum listing of others having the same issue. As you can see, this is very widespread.
 
I have found that the spacebar will release the hand tool for normal use, so I now think that the problem is the coding for the hand tool over-riding all other tools when used to move the stage or workspace onscreen. This is, afterall, a programmed use (and a good one) when other tools are selected and you need to quickly adjust the workspace.
 
I have the same issues. I use Adobe Illustrator with the brush tool with my Wacom, which always gets stuck for me. When illustrating in Ai, I use a combination of my pen and the space bar for navigation. The hand tool appears when I use the space bar and goes away when I release it. It gets stuck randomly. When I hit save and the file is large, I attempt to move the page while it's saving a file, or I switch between apps. I don't know what triggers it, but it happens.
 
I use a wireless keyboard, and the keyboard spacebar isn't stuck. It's a combo of things happening and a bug. The keyboard, Wacom, and Adobe may think the spacebar is still active, so it doesn't switch back to the previous tool when the spacebar shortcut is activated.
 
When this bug happens, I cut the power to my keyboard, which triggers the spacebar bug loop to close becuase the system is no longer connected to the keyboard. The tool resets itself, and I can go back to work.
 
I'm a newbie, so this is probably obvious, but I can't find it in any tutorials or documentation. In Illustrator I want to maintain the stroke settings while creating several paths with the pen tool. However, every time I start a new path, the stroke settings revert to what must be a default. E.g. I set 16pt + Variable width profile + Basic and stroke a path. When I start a new path, the settings revert to 1pt + Uniform + Basic, and I have to reset back to my original. Other art programs I've used maintain the tool settings most recently used until they are manually changed. How can I get the settings to stay through multiple uses of the pen tool? Thanks.
 
In the course of playing around in Illustrator to find a solution, I found that if you open your appearance panel (**Window > Appearance**), select the fly-out menu and deselect **New Art has Basic Appearance.**
 
The appearance panel is now built into the properties tab and doesn't have a fly out menu with options. I have searched other menus and properties and can not find "New Art has basic appearance" anywhere!
 
Why is this not the default!!! Thank you. I am finding every new tool I learn I have to Google Why doesn't this work the obvious way. There is typically some short cut keys I have to press or some weird order I have to do it in to get it to work like everyone seems to assume it should.
 
None of this worked for me. my pen tool wont stay in the basic line type and keeps changing back to the previously used one. It wont maintain the thickness or line type i command and its ruining my project. Pen tool is literally useless.
 
Hello! I am on CC 2019 illustrator and I am having this same or similar problem. I unchecked the option mentioned above but the pen tool changes settings everytime I click a different shape. Is there a way to maintain the pen tool settings no matter what object you click?
 
Hi everyone:

I am a new user of affinity designer, I want to get the most out of this program, I have been an Illustrator user for many years and I would like to know if there are some tools that I used in that program but I have not found them in Affinity Designer. I am looking for an equivalent of the Illustrator Fusion tool in affinity designer, with this tool you can make an automatic repetition between one line and another or from one polygon to another, for me it is a very important tool and I do not know if there is something similar. I really appreciate your help and I apologize if my English is not the best, greetings.
 
I'd like to see more adjustment options for the knife tool. Something like the pencil tools option of Tolerances: Fidelity and Smoothness. It sure would help with more precision when I cut and ink my manga characters. Rather than go in after I make a cut and have to move a lot of anchor points and handles around by hand to get the precision I was after in the first place.
 
I hope you can understand what I'm texting about here and I hope you take this issue up and include it in a future feature update. Oh yea, and also if it would be possible to make it where we can set a hotkey option to the knife and scissor tool as well. Thanks for your time and a great program.
 
They were really helpful as I had bought it from Amazon and not their official website after reading about them as the best high end edc knife here: -high-end-edc-knife/. If you want one, definitely buy it from a trusted site like amazon and after reading a review on it.
 
I think the Knife tool default should be straight cuts rather than curved. If this were the case, you coul
