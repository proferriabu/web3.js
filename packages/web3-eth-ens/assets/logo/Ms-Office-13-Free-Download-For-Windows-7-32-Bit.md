If you already redeemed a product key, you're simply reinstalling the apps, or you know you have an assigned license through work or school, you can skip ahead and go to the section sign in to download and install Microsoft 365 or Office. However, if this is the first time you're installing Microsoft 365 or Office, you may have some steps to do first. Expand the Learn more section below for more info.

If this is the first time you're installing Microsoft 365 or Office, you may have to complete a set of pre-installation steps or you may need to follow different steps than what's shown below. What you do depends on if your copy of Microsoft 365 or Office is a home or a business product and whether or not you have a product key that you still need to redeem, an account already associated with your product, or a pre-assigned license.
 
Go to office.com/setup and sign in with an existing or new Microsoft account and then enter your product key to redeem it\*. Redeeming your key is what adds your Microsoft account to Microsoft 365 and you only have to do this once. If you're renewing a Microsoft 365 subscription with a new product key, use the same Microsoft account you previously associated with your expired version subscription.

Learn how to check this in What Microsoft 365 business product or license do I have? or if you're a Microsoft 365 admin responsible for assigning licenses to people in your organization, see Assign licenses to users.
 
Once you verify you have a license, anytime you need to install or reinstall Microsoft 365 you can go straight to the section below, Sign in to download Office and select the tab for steps to install on a PC or Mac. You'll sign in with your work or school account for these versions of Microsoft 365.
 
The 64-bit version is installed by default unless Microsoft 365 or Office detects you already have a 32-bit version of Microsoft 365 or Office (or a stand-alone app such as Project or Visio) installed. In this case, the 32-bit version of Microsoft 365 or Office will be installed instead.
 
To change from a 32-bit version to a 64-bit version or vice versa, you need to uninstall Microsoft 365 first (including any stand-alone Microsoft 365 apps you have such as Project of Visio). Once the uninstall is complete, sign in again to www.office.com and select Other install options, choose the language and version you want (64 or 32-bit), and then select Install. (See Install Visio or Install Project if you need to reinstall those stand-alone apps.)
 
Your install is finished when you see the phrase, "You're all set! Office is installed now" and an animation plays to show you where to find Microsoft 365 applications on your computer. Select Close.
 
The What's New window opens automatically when you launch Word. Click Get Started to start activating. If you need help activating Microsoft 365 or Office, see Activate Microsoft 365 or Office for Mac. If activation fails, see What to try if you can't install or activate Microsoft 365 or Office for Mac.
 
If you have an home product and bought Microsoft 365 or Office at a retail store or online store, but don't have a Microsoft account, it's possible you haven't redeemed your product key yet (if you got one), or you missed the step for linking your recent purchase with an account. Do the following to link an account with Microsoft 365 or Office.
 
For an Office for home product, go to office.com/setup and create a new Microsoft account or sign in with an existing one, then follow the remaining steps on that page such as entering your product key (if you have one). Your account is successfully associated with Microsoft 365 or Office when you see the page, My Office Account followed by your Microsoft account email address, and a button to install the apps. Select the PC or Mac tabs above to help you with the rest of the install process.
 
After signing in with your work or school account you don't see an option to install the desktop applications on the Microsoft 365 home page, go directly to the Microsoft 365 Software page instead. Select the language and bit-version you want (PC users can choose between 32-bit and 64-bit), and then click Install. See Step 2 and 3 on the PC or Mac tabs above to help you with the rest of the install process.
 
If you still don't see an option to install Microsoft 365 on the Microsoft 365 Software page, it's possible your admin hasn't assigned a license to you. Find out if you have a license to install Microsoft 365.
 
If you're trying to sign in with your work or school account to www.office.com and your sign in is blocked, it likely means your Microsoft 365 administrator set up a security policy that's preventing you from signing in to that location.
 
To install Microsoft 365, try signing in directly to the Microsoft 365 Software page instead. Select the language and bit-version you want (PC users can choose between 32-bit and 64-bit), and then click Install.

Not all versions of Microsoft 365 include a key, but if yours did, you need to redeem it before you can install Microsoft 365. Go to office.com/setup and sign in with an existing Microsoft account or create a new one, then enter your product key. Follow the remaining prompts to finish linking your Microsoft account with this version of Microsoft 365.

For a one-time purchase of Office such as Office Home & Student, Office Home & Business, or Office Professional: You can install these non-subscription versions of Office on only one computer. However, you may transfer Office to another computer that belongs to you if you experience a hardware failure, or you buy a new computer. For more information, see the Microsoft License Terms.
 
If you bought a stand-alone version of an Office app, for example Visio or Word, in most cases you install this app in the same way you install the Microsoft 365 or Office suite, by signing in to www.office.com with your Microsoft account, or work or school account and selecting Install for your stand-alone product.
 
If you have a subscription to Project Online Professional, Project Online Premium, or Visio Pro, see Install Project, or Install Visio for the steps to install the apps that are part of those subscriptions.
 
If Microsoft 365 or Office seems to be taking a very long time to install, this may be caused by problems with your internet connection, firewall, or anti-virus software. For possible solutions, see Microsoft 365 or Office is taking long to install.
 
Microsoft 365 can also take long to install because of a slow internet connection (such as a dial-up connection). If you don't have a good connection, install Microsoft 365 using the Use the offline installer.

To configure and perform deployments of Office LTSC 2021, including Project and Visio, for users in your organization, you use the Office Deployment Tool (ODT). The Office Customization Tool (OCT) that you previously used for Windows Installer (MSI) is no longer used.
 
The installation files for Office LTSC 2021 are available on the Office Content Delivery Network (CDN) on the internet instead of on the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC). You can install Office LTSC 2021 directly from the Office CDN. Or, you can download the installation files from the Office CDN to a location on your local network, such as a shared folder, and install Office LTSC 2021 from that location.
