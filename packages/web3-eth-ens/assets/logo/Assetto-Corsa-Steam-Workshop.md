Before unsubscribing I have backed up some large mod. Then as I installed the game, open the launcher, and finish options, I put the backed up mods into the mod folder where is to store subscriptions.

What's more I find it first downloads contents into XX\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\workshop\downloads, then copy it into the XX\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\workshop\content\107410 folder, Then it will put another copy into my mod folder, Whitch means, it downloads the content once and copys it to another two different place, then delets itself.
 
Why I choose a mod folder? Because the driver I installed ARMA3 is SSD and it is smaller than my HDD. I wish to download the mod into my HDD, but now I find that in my SSD driver it still has one copy! (the game is in
 
Oh so it was partially because of this. I've already had some weird corruption issues with Arma 3 subscribed content for three weeks already. It wanted to download something for Assetto Corsa that doesn't even have Steam Workshop so it looped that download all the time. I noticed the same issue that you have but I thought it was only because of the issue I had.
 
I needed to unsubscribe every Arma 3 Workshop content and then i deleted the \workshop\content\107410 folder or maybe I did delete the whole workshop folder. Then I opened the Arma 3 Launcher and deleted the folder once again. I maybe repeated this couple of times just in case because of my issue. I also noticed before I deleted it that there were some mod .pbos just like you said but there aren't those anymore left after I cleaned like i said. Only .bin files left. It doesn't harm to delete that folder because the stuff automatically gets downloaded back. It might take a while.

That way you should get rid of from all the Arma 3 mod .pbos in your workshop folder. Dunno if there's easier way for you because my corruption. Maybe you only need to delete the folder and that's it, no need to unsub stuff. Try that first.
 
So yes this is a big issue. We shouldn't have mods installed in the XX\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\workshop\content\107410, so please BIS fix that! Or otherwise the new Workshop mods install folder is worthless feature.
 
My game is in SSD,**I hope the MOD is in HDD only**, but **107410 folder**is in SSD too. So the MOD subscribed from steam workshop is always in SSD with one copy or 2 copies. 
HOWEVER contents downloaded from XXholic, XXinfo and PlayWithXXX etc. can all be in HDD.
 
OR I have to unsubscribe all the MODs and download them from other traditional place. Anyway I have to download RHS, AIA, IceBreakr ISLAND series etc. famous MODs in other site, such as xxholic, play withxxx.
 
OK I deleted once again and now I'm 252MB. I see again only .bin format files. Maybe it now remains like that just like with R3vo :D There are now much less folders inside \SteamApps\workshop\content\107410\ but I still have all my subbed mods inside the defined Steam Workshop mod folder. I also noticed interesting thing that 4 mods were marked as updated and all of them were not signed mods but I have 7 folders so three of the mods are likely missions.
 
So seems like not signed mods and then missions get in there in .bin format. If there's something else then keep on deleting because they shouldn't get downloaded there in the format that mod folder has. And seems like only Not signed mods and missions gets in there.
 
And out of a sudden Steam starts to download mods also in the worshop folder, WTF?! Tries to download 4GB of mods that i already have. Seems like it worked only for two days and then Steam started to do its own again...
 
Don't use the workshop man. It's really that simple. I'm running currently 90 GB of MODs none of them subscribed to the workshop. I just did it the old way before ground breaking Steam took over. I have had no problems nor double folders from workshop, no nothing. Why is it so hard to do it manually like before is beyond my understanding for being honest.
