As Masmassu says, they are mostly going to provide a speed benefit (previously they also affected material costs, but that has recently been shifted to the benches - so the new higher tier crafting stations provide the crafting cost reductions instead). Armorers and Blacksmiths (and carpenters for bows/arrows) also provide increases to durability, damage/armor rating, armor penetration etc, and reductions to weight - a t2 provides more benefit than t1, t3 provides more benefit than t2 etc.
 
A rule of thumb that seems to be holding true for me so far is that, whatever benefits the t4 specialists can provide, all the thralls of that type provide lesser versions of all those same benefits (the specialists are just much better in their specific area). This may not be 100% accurate, but it seems to be working out for me so far.

Exceptional and Flawless qualities have also been removed (though, in reality, because each tier of crafting thrall provides increasing benefits to the same elements that exceptional and flawless benefited, the actual result is much the same (if not better) just without being called exceptional or flawless.
 
b) you still have considerable knowledge of many aspects of the game, and of its history, the changes it has been through etc. Sure, some bits may have changed on pc, but a lot remains the same as well.
 
Compared to t4, t1 to t3 were always way inferior, new updates are not different.
Crafters from lower tiers will craft items better than the player, always. So, while you get your t4 for every station in your base, t1 to 3 will be good enough to have, as always.
 
Yeah I understood the old mechanics for thralls but just trying to get a good feel as to what benefits T1 thru T3 now give with the change to the new crafting benches. I did take a look at the wiki before and it basically just said that there were changes needed updated.

For this week's Crafter's Roundtable, let's talk about how itemization will work when character levels are taken into account, and what that means for crafting.
 
 Should Pantheon have a system of "tiers" of item power, that map to level ranges? (ie, 1-8, 9-16, 17-24, etc)
 If yes, how many tiers should there be? And how should the requirements to make items change from one tier to the next?
 
 This is an important topic that affects a lot of aspects of the game, both crafting related and not. So make sure to voice your opinion!
 
Each week, Pantheon Crafters posts a discussion topic for the crafting community to talk about. We call these Crafter's Roundtables and we post them both on our site's forums as well as here on the Pantheon forums, so feel free to join the discussion in both places if you'd like.

They all end up beeing tiers of some sort, because that would make little sense to have a banded boots lvl 15 and chestmail lvl 25. Or at least it wouldn't if it is the required level to equip. Since pantheon is going for a "you can equip everything" style, tiers and such are harder to classify.
 
First I would split the concepts of tiers into two categories, crafting tier and combat tier. Crafting tier refers to the relative difficulty of the recipe to learn, the time it takes to craft the item, and the relative number of maximum enhancements that can be on the item. Combat tier refers to the combat skill levels required to use the item at maximum power. High tier crafting recipes will have higher default combat tiers when made as a basic item. Additionally high combat tier secondary ingredients can be added to a low tier crafting recipe to create a high tier combat item (but not a min/maxed one). The best results are from both top tier crafting recipes with top combat tier secondary ingredients.
 
An example could be chainmail armor. Basic chainmail (4 in 1 European chain mail) is a tier 1 armor smith recipe. It can only take one enhancement which will usually be the level magnitude of the armor class that the item is made for. The tier 2 chainmail armor is kings mail / double mail (8 in 2 mail). Kings mail takes twice as much iron, weights twice as much and can accept 2 enhancements, commonly this will be the level magnitude and a weight reducer though if you are strong enough you could use a strength or constitution enhancement. Tier 3 would be riveted 4 in 1 and Tier 4 is riveted Kings mail. Each tier of armor takes roughly twice the amount of time to craft as the previous tier and requires 10 levels higher in crafting to learn.
 
I think I would like to see the basic raw materials to be localized to the cultural crafting of the area and not tiered, i.e. each area has its own iron equivalent based on lore. There is also room for other sources of special base material but it should be optional material and not required for leveling crafting. The basic raw materials will affect the look and some very minor property differences of the final object. The optional secondary ingredients that set the combat tier of the final product should be tiered for game balance reasons.
 
I do feel this is overly complicated for results not as much as the trouble it brings. I prefer static recipes over "enhancement chosen" items, especially as Pantheon is a multi-stats game and you should not happen to focus on BiS statistics as much as you will. Sometimes you should have some wisdom even as a tank, or strength as a magician and it shouldn't feel like a pain but offer you some diverging benefits, like weight capability and such.
 
We all know that if you choose the enhancement you put on an item, or if you can recraft them untill you get what you want, everyone will focus on main stat and constitution with little attention to anything else.

I'm not a fan of tiers but more a fan of just complexity and difficulty in the creation itself. A basic chainmail shirt would have a skill difficulty of X while a better version of a chainmail shirt, like the double chainmail mentioned above, would have a difficulty of X+Y. The items needed would be different either in just pure raw materials or in sub-components. So you might need just 1000 Steel Rings for the basic chainmail shirt but the double chainmail shirt could need 2000 Steel Rings plus 1 Gambeson. The combine for the 2 sub-components would require a higher skill than the single combine.
 
Kinda of pointlessly annoying you need a crafter who already had Tier 3 to make the stuff needed to get this, but at least that will become easier to get over time since you can now actually get it.

Kind of sad they didn't just give us an "Old" version of Naxx like old Scholomance with all the drops in place. Pointlessly removing and keeping things out of the game to abide by bad decisions made from 2008 onward seems like a bad idea
 
Damn no DK love. :( i wish we can use t3 warrior set at least.

If it just creates the pieces as they currently exist off the BMAH then they have no class requirements. I've been using the paladin and warrior sets on my DK for ages.
 
At first I thought that they were doing things well, we would spend gold creating the item that can only be created by people who already have the achievement, but they decided to make another item in which we should spend about 2.8m on only that item, without take into account the price of the other item that we need to create, it is too expensive to create a single set, I have already seen comments from some people saying that they spent more than 5m in BMAH, that 2.8m is cheap, no, it is not, it is a tier set of classic, the idea that they should have taken to bring back this T3 should be to give more accessibility to people who precisely cannot afford to spend so much gold on BMAH, they have done exactly the same with BMAH, the only difference is that you should no longer wait so many days to try to win it, now it is secured but you still spend too much gold in the process, a lousy way to re-introduce this T3, quite disappointing, hopefully they change it.
 
So a crafter would have to unlock old Scholomance, then unlock old Naxxramas, unlock the vendor, get 20 Chips which are either a hard-grind or two weeks of clearing Naxx, have 300 in either Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, or Tailoring...

That's actually wild. 2.8M in vendor costs, probably another million more in commission/gatekeep prices.
 
2.8 mil gold jesus, it could be cheaper at bmah

I think that's the point. Tier three was a super exclusive set since very people where able to get it in vanilla or TBC. The point of this crazy cost is to keep it exclusive AND make it accessible. Honestly this seems like a pretty okay compromise all things said and done.
 
This is so stupid. 2.8 million per set, what's even the point? 

I earned 2 sets of T3 in Classic, why can't I mog that? 

Absolutely ridiculous pricing. Maybe if it was 1/10th of this price I'd consider it but ^&\*! this for a joke.
 
2.8mil and the mats from someone who already has it, wow. i'm on a small server, like below 50 /who, and i think i have a little over 150k. don't see how ill be able to even come close to doing this. was really excited id be able to get past bmah bid wars so i could have a fancy shoulder for my clown suit of old stuff. im glad they brought old naxx stuff back, i just wish they didnt lock it behind so much
