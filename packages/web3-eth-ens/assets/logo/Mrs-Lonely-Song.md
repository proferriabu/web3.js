Before we got management and an agent, we were playing wherever would have us. But, within a year and a half, we went from releasing an album to opening for the Rolling Stones, playing festivals like Bonnaroo and Coachella, and getting my first passport so I could play shows around the world. The normal life I was headed to, and happy for, was changed (although Caroline and I did find the time to get married amidst it all). For the next few years, our lives were a series of shows and albums, measured in short spurts home and long times away.

This changed in January of 2020 when my wife and I found out she was pregnant. We were always on the fence about children. We were happy together and were worried that a child would make us unhappy or unfocused on our own ambitions. But, after nearly a decade together, we decided we wanted to have a child who we could share our love with. This thing that already made us so scared was made terrifying by a year of global unrest and uncertainty.
 
This juxtaposition between fear and comfort inspired me to write. Alongside the questions that we all faced, I was coming to terms with parenthood. But, I also welcomed the boredom of a steady home. And finally, I had the time to document this life in song. The songs that came out of that time became an album written with my daughter in mind, with all my hopes entangled with my fears. But, this time, and maybe for the first time, I wrote with love as a foundation, and while this was therapeutic, that was never the goal.
 
My daughter was born two weeks after we recorded *Angels in Science Fiction*. And, I will always be grateful that before our new life as a family began, this boring home gave me the chance to finally write a love song. And finally, my wife has a song just for her.

"**Lonely**" is a song by Senegalese-American singer-songwriter Akon; it appears on his debut album, *Trouble*. Featuring a prominent, high-pitched sample of the 1964 song "Mr. Lonely" by Bobby Vinton,[4] the single was released on February 22, 2005. "Lonely" reached number one in several countries, including in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany, where it stayed for eight weeks. It also entered the top five in France, where it reached number two, and in the United States, where it peaked at number four.
 
When Akon was signed by Universal imprint SRC Records it was "Lonely" that had immediately caught the attention of SRC A&R Jerome Foster and convinced him of Akon's talents.[5] On hearing the demo track he had said, "This kid is official - this is a huge record."[5] Despite offering the album's best option in terms of commercial breakthrough, SRC Records chose "Locked Up" over "Lonely" as the first single because SRC wanted to break Akon in the streets first and work towards a cross-over.[5] According to Foster in an interview with HitQuarters, ""Locked Up" is a street record. I thought that was the place for us to start to get a fan-base knowing that we had a record like "Lonely", which was more commercial, to follow it."[5]
 
The song was written by Akon, Bobby Vinton, and Gene Allan. The lyrics are sung mainly by Akon as well as Bobby Vinton doing parts of the choruses, with Vinton's voice sped up reminiscent of Alvin and the Chipmunks.[6] The song's tempo is 90 beats per minute in common time. "Lonely" is written in the key of C major.[7]
 
A music video was produced to promote the single. The video was mostly filmed inside and in front of the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. The video was directed by Gil Green. Actress Katerina Graham starred in the video as Akon's love partner. A competition winner from Blackpool, Daniel Ellwood, also starred in the video.[*citation needed*]
 
The song was a number-one hit in several countries, including Australia, Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Belgium, and Switzerland. The song reached number two in France, Norway, and Sweden. The song also reached number 19 in Finland.[10]
 
I was driving up Highland Avenue. The other day, as in a year ago. And I was thinking about my situation, which I very often do. It's my pastime, is [sings] thinkin' about my situation, yeah. I didn't think I was gonna put that to music. It still sounds alright if you sing it.
 
So all of a sudden I write down, in my phone on the way to the studio, these two words: Perfectly. Lonely. Anybody out there consider themselves to be perfectly lonely? And yes, sometimes on a Friday or a Saturday, the phone doesn't buzz a lot. And sometimes that hurts your ego. Sometimes that hurts your ego to know there's nobody out there just wantin' you to come over. But the people who have to write you last minute to tell you to come over, they're not good for you. They're not good for you. Have your plans before 2 o'clock in the morning. Take that from your uncle John. Have your plans figured out before 2 o'clock in the morning. So to anyone else who enjoys their whole situation right now. To anybody who's trying to take a dark situation and turn it into a bright one by being alone, cause [sings] being alone can be fun, fun, yeah!
 
**Bart Herbison:** Let's start with a personal congratulations-- long overdue. You were finally inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame last year. That has to be really fulfilling, Kostas.
 
**K:** Yeah, I went over to James's house. We were hanging out and playing a lot back in that time period and writing a few songs together too...But there's not much to say about it. It was probably inspired by some elements in my life that I was going through at that time.
 
**BH:**It's what everybody goes through, and I think maybe the commonality (of that experience) and the way you (put the experience in the composition) is why the song, at least to me, is so special.
 
**K:**Well, I think you're right. I think hit songs, especially radio hit songs, have to be reflective like a mirror, so that all of society that's listening can see themselves if they want to. If there is that possibility in the song to see yourself, a good song will do that. And that's what you aim for.

She is gray-eyed and pale of skin, or so the story goes, and her hair is a coal-black waterfall with half-seen hints of red. She wears about her brow a circlet of burnished metal, a dark crown that holds her hair in place and sometimes puts shadows in her eyes. Her name is Sharra; she knows the gates.
 
We have only the middle, or rather a piece of that middle, the smallest part of the legend, a mere fragment of the quest. A small tale within the greater, of one world where Sharra paused, and of the lonely singer Laren Dorr and how they briefly touched.
 
One moment there was only the valley, caught in twilight. The setting sun hung fat and violet on the ridge above, and its rays slanted down silently into a dense forest whose trees had shiny black trunks and colorless ghostly leaves. The only sounds were the cries of the mourning-birds coming out for the night, and the swift rush of water in the rocky stream that cut the woods.
 
Then, through a gate unseen, Sharra came tired and bloodied to the world of Laren Dorr. She wore a plain white dress, now stained and sweaty, and a heavy fur cloak that had been half-ripped from her back. And her left arm, bare and slender, still bled from three long wounds. She appeared by the side of the stream, shaking, and she threw a quick, wary glance about her before she knelt to dress her wounds. The water, for all its swiftness, was a dark and murky green. No way to tell if it was safe, but Sharra was weak and thirsty. She drank, washed her arm as best she could in the strange and doubtful water, and bound her injuries with bandages ripped from her clothes. Then, as the purple sun dipped lower behind the ridge, she crawled away from the water to a sheltered spot among the trees and fell into exhausted sleep.
 
Sharra woke at dawn, when shafts of bright purple light spilled into her room through a high arched window that had not been there the night before. Clothing had been laid out for her:a loose yellow robe, a jeweled dress of bright crimson, a suit of forest green. She chose the suit, dressed quickly. As she left, she paused to look out the window.
 
She was in a tower, looking out over crumbling stone battlements and a dusty triangular courtyard. Two other towers, twisted matchstick things with pointed conical spires, rose from the other corners of the triangle. There was a strong wind that whipped the rows of gray pennants set along the walls, but no other motion to be seen.
 
And, beyond the castle walls, no sign of the valley, none at all. The castle with its courtyard and its crooked towers was set atop a mountain, and far and away in all directions taller mountains loomed, presenting a panorama of black stone cliffs and jagged rocky walls and shining clean ice steeples that gleamed with a violet sheen. The window was sealed and closed, but the wind looked cold.
 
Her door was open. Sharra moved quickly down a twisting stone staircase, out across the courtyard into the main building, a low wooden structure built against the wall. She passed through countless rooms, some cold and empty save for dust, others richly furnished, before she found Laren Dorr eating breakfast.
 
They stood side by side on a small balcony atop the highest of the three towers, Sh
