Edited to add- Yes triples are hard on tires and I would have to think that quads would be just as bad or worse. The guy that hauls hogs for us complains quite often about the tire wear on the triple axle trailer he pulls.

Travis is mostly seen hauling a wooden open **trailer**. It was once hauled by Roley and Muck. The trailer is brown-red, has black tires with grey metal hub caps. The trailer also has several metal screws attached to it to keep the wood panels together. There are 2 small hooks at the end of the trailer that winch onto two screws that pop out of the sides of the trailer's opening door.
 
In A Christmas To Remember, Travis is also given a longer trailer with the same wooden design, colour, and wheel colour, though the hub caps are notably different. He also uses this trailer to haul pieces of the sunflower factory for Farmer Pickles in the Project Build It episode, Meet Marjorie.
 
The **Line Marking Machine** is a machine that creates paints of line onto the ground. Bob was supposed to paint several white lines in the middle of the road with it, but he got interrupted when Mrs. Potts needed him to fix her fence. Spud coupled the machine behind Travis and tricked him to pull it with him all the way to the pond. Travis, thinking he is pulling his trailer, left white lines on the road behind him. As a punishment for his trickery, Spud had to clean all the white stripes off the road even throughout the night. Wendy was later using it to paint the white line in a football field.
 
The **Animal Trailer** is a wooden covered trailer which only appeared in the episode Travis' Giddy Day. It was hauled by Travis and was used to take Giddy to her goat run in Sunflower Valley. However, after going too fast, the trailer hit some trees and broke.
 
Richmond, a fourth-generation Wood River Valley native, returned to the Wood River Valley just before the pandemic hit after studying at Lewis Clark State College in Lewiston. He spent his first summers after college working as a river guide, then decided it was time for an office job.
 
The two devised a business plan and got a bank loan. Then they sat down with Food Concept Idaho, a food truck manufacturer in Nampa, to design a 16-foot trailer with two fryers and two ovens. They wrapped the finished product with their Tater Trailer logo with the help of Windy City Arts sign shop in Hailey.
 
Richmond and Prokasky staked out their trailer in the food truck court next to Whiskey Jacques with the idea of being able to offer food to the downtown crowd after nine when most restaurants have closed.
 
The truck offers a variety of fries and tater tots, including tasty crunchy sweet potato tots. The mainstay is humongous baked potatoes as long as 7 inches covered with such toppings as barbecued pulled chicken, poutine gravy, Philadelphia cheese steak, chili and cheese and extras like caramelized onions and gravy.
 
Read most of the above and some good points made, i have a small outfit that i use on mainly our own jobs or salvaging wind blown timber that we have been paid to sort out, as most of the work is generally down footpaths with in blocks of forestry from 100 - 900 acres it makes cense for us to run a small tractor and forwarding trailer, we all so have a Igland 4.2 tonne winch for it as well, it all seems to work well and even tho when it comes to the timber salvaging its at my expence but it works, main of the timber we salvage we process in to firewood our selves and sell on,, the trailer i have is about ready for a bit of a refurb and the crane needs a bit of attension as it was only one of the cheaper ones and was bought to do 2 jobs but thats 10+ yrs since, knowing what i know now i would not skimp on the crane as there is some very good small cranes out there today, only done a few paid extraction jobs with it and i was charging 28hr with a 2 a mile transport charge 1 way, i like extracting with mine and only problem is getting me off it,,
 
As for the dedicated small forwarders I don't think I want to spend my entire life forwarding timber and I think you might have to to get a return on the investment. I think they're about 30-60k, would have to move a lot of wood to make that pay. My thinking was that a trailer behind the tractor is another string in the bow and keeps life a bit more interesting. I think if I could get a month or two of work for it a year I'd be happy. I can see the benefit of those dedicated forwarders though, they all look like really handy machines and far more efficient than tractor/trailer.
 
Just another thought - I had originally intended to get a rotating grab for my 2.6t digger and make up a little trailer to tow along with it. I was put off by the price of the grabs though, about 3k+vat - nearing half the price of a forwarding trailer for the tractor. Mini digger would be limited to short runs though.
 
Tractor and trailer does ok for us, i was working along side a log bullet mini forwarder on a job 2 year ago and i could move at least twice as much at a time and when your on a long haul it makes a diffarence,, then there is the resale issue as well, a small tractor will appeal to a much larger selling audience than a purpose built forwarder,, i think i would get back what i paid for mine and about the same for the trailer and crane, we use a little 2,8t digger with a fixed grab and it works well in thinings as we stack the timber ryde side and windrow the brash with it as with it being a fixed grab you can rake or push brash with it which i find is very labour saving,,
 
Going to look at a job next wk where some windblown has taken a drystone wall down so its price for windblown clearance then rebuild the wall, could be 25 -30 tonne of timber which will be ours for the removal of it so tractor n trailer and the winch come in to there own in this situation, we will sever the trees and winch back in to the woodland whole, then sned and process with in the wood hence no brash to drag back, it all works out most days then one day you get every thing going wrong !! get your trailer with crane then make a braket up to swap grab between trailer and digger, but when you put it back on tractor put half a gallon of oil to dump out of grab n rotator as you would be putting hydraulic oil in to the back end of your tractor which aint good but the other way your UTO out of tractor in to digger would be fine,,
 
Yes i looked at the Riko ones and some others supplied by ryteck, then decided to build one it was originally built for use behind a quad but spent more time on its side than on its wheels do we redesigned it for use either at 4ft wide behind a quad or at 5ft,6" when behind the tractor, 3tonne on it when behind tractor but some times it will of been more, 3mte beech n oak thinnings soon start adding up,,
