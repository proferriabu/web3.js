"American Door & Window recently installed new windows throughout our home. From start to finish we could not have asked for better service. We can not say enough good things about this company and we highly recommend them. Thank you, Kevin."
 
"We needed 25 window screens repaired in our home. We contacted 3 local companies and ONLY American Window and Door Company came to our home to correctly measure and give us a quote for re-screening and repair of all of our window screens."
 
"I recently replaced all of the windows in my house with Quaker Windows from American Window and Door. Their team is fast, thorough, and professional. My window order arrived when they said it would, and the installation started and finished on time. As a matter of fact, all of the windows were replaced in one day. They just had to return the next day to finish caulking and wrapping the windows. Little things put them over the top. The windows have stops that you can use to prevent the window from being raised above a certain height for security. The stops on two of my windows were not right. American WD ordered new spots and replaced them within a few days. They were very diligent to contact me and schedule a time to replace them which was good because it had actually slipped my mind to do that. I'm very happy with their service and I would use them on any window project in the future."
 
From broken glass to worn out windows, you can rely on Glass Doctor of Memphis to repair the damage. We carry out routine and emergency repairs to the highest standards, coming to your home at a time that suits you and providing you with a price estimate before we start work. The following are our most popular glass and window repair services available to homeowners.
 
When you suffer from a broken window, you can count on our specialists to arrive promptly to your home, even in the middle of the night. We repair as much as possible, even replacing the glass if we have a pane in stock that meets your needs. If we are unable to make a full repair on the spot, we will board up your window, clear away the broken glass, and arrange a time to return at your earliest convenience.
 
If your windows appear foggy, the seals may be broken and condensation building up between the panes. This means you need a double pane window repair. We are often able to replace just the panes, keeping frames the same, to save you time and money and to maintain your curb appeal.
 
In addition to our window repair services, we replace and repair glass decor. We can install new glass in garage doors, mirrors, tabletops, patio doors, cabinets, entry doors, and just about anywhere that needs an update. Our specialists at Glass Doctor of Memphis will create a custom design for you.
 
There is no need to wait for seals to break before upgrading to better-insulated glass units (IGUs). If you want to improve your energy efficiency, enhance your home comfort, and control noise pollution, talk to one of our specialists about switching to newer IGUs, like double pane or triple pane windows, or to low-emissivity windows. Many are available with tinting to protect occupants and furnishings from UV rays and to lower energy costs yet further. We can recommend the best option for your needs and budget.
 
Protect your glass from damage like stains and scratches with an application of hydrophobic coating glass protectant. You can also use the product on granite, tile, and porcelain to keep surfaces safe from hard water, dirt, environmental pollutants, and weathering.
 
Trouble opening or locking windows may be down to a broken mechanism. Our specialists at Glass Doctor of Memphis are able to repair all types of locking mechanisms, including balances, sash locks, and tilt latches.
