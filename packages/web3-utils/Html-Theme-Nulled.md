HTML Website templates provide an easy solution to getting the look you want for your website without having to mess around with too much code. Even though every framework has its pros and cons, when building a website with an HTML template you get the advantage of easier access to the underlying code, as opposed to WordPress. Let alone the possibility of being faster when setting up and creating your website.

Found a layout you like but not sure about the colors? Fear not. All website templates come with easy-to-follow instructions so editing them is a breeze. You can also head over to our forums where other users can help with layout changes and editing.
 
HTML website templates on ThemeForest are loved by millions of customers around the world. Unlike WordPress themes, which consist of all the pages of the site and allow you to customize font and style in the WP dashboard, these design templates are built in HTML. You can edit the template in an HTML editor, but not on WordPress, as their structure doesn't include the WP system.
 
Finally, remember that you can find both multi-purpose and niche templates. While multi-purpose templates are created to suit any kind of website, and may contain more layouts and styling options for this reason, niche templates have been built with a specific purpose or market in mind. We're talking about themes from categories like Non-profit, Wedding, Health, and more. So whatever you're looking for - you'll sure find something that suits your needs in our collection. Enjoy the search, and if you need a little help editing the template once it's yours, check out Tuts+ tutorial How to Customize an HTML Template.
 
You can do extensive customization of themes using Sass. Bootstrap defines over 1,400 Sass variables that control fonts, colors, padding, borders, and much more. You can see all of the variables here:

Sass theme files can define both variables that globally set things like colors and fonts, as well as rules that define more fine grained behavior. To customize an existing Bootstrap theme with your own set of variables and/or rules, just provide the base theme and then your custom theme file(s):
 
The first appearance (light or dark) elements in the theme to determine the default appearance for your html output. For example, since the light option appears first in the above example, a reader will see the light appearance by default.
 
As when providing a single theme, you may provide a custom theme for dark and light mode, or a list of scss files to customize the light and dark appearance. This website, for example uses the following to use a light cosmo theme and then customizes the cosmo theme with additional Sass variables when in dark mode:
 
The **theme-color** value for the name attribute of the element indicates a suggested color that user agents should use to customize the display of the page or of the surrounding user interface. If specified, the content attribute must contain a valid CSS .
 
Using a theme provided with Sphinx is easy. Since thesedo not need to be installed, you only need to set the html\_themeconfig value. For example, to enable the classic theme, add the followingto conf.py:
 
If the theme does not come with Sphinx, it can be in two static forms or as aPython package. For the static forms, either a directory (containingtheme.toml and other needed files), or a zip file with the samecontents is supported. The directory or zipfile must be put where Sphinx canfind it; for this there is the config value html\_theme\_path. Thiscan be a list of directories, relative to the directory containingconf.py, that can contain theme directories or zip files. For example,if you have a theme in the file blue.zip, you can put it right in thedirectory containing conf.py and use this configuration:
 
This is a basically unstyled layout used as the base for theother themes, and usable as the base for custom themes as well. The HTMLcontains all important elements like sidebar and relation bar. There arethese options (which are inherited by the other themes):
 
**globaltoc\_includehidden** (true or false): Show even thosesubsections in globaltoc.html (see html\_sidebars)which have been included with the :hidden: flag of thetoctree directive.Defaults to False.
 
**globaltoc\_maxdepth** (int): The maximum depth of the toctree inglobaltoc.html (see html\_sidebars). Set it to -1 to allowunlimited depth. Defaults to the max depth selected in the toctree directive.
 
**full\_logo** (true or false, default False): If this is true, theheader will only show the html\_logo. Use this for large logos.If this is false, the logo (if present) will be shown floating right, andthe documentation title will be put in the header.
 
sphinx-themes.org is a gallery that showcases various themes for Sphinx,with demo documentation rendered under each theme. Themes can also be foundon PyPI (using the classifier Framework :: Sphinx :: Theme), GitHuband GitLab.
 
**pygments\_style** (table): A TOML table defining the names of Pygments stylesto use for highlighting syntax.The table has two recognised keys: default and dark.The style defined in the dark key will be used whenthe CSS media query (prefers-color-scheme: dark) evaluates to true.
 
The [options] table defines the options for the theme.It is structured such that each key-value pair corresponds to a variable nameand the corresponding default value.These options can be overridden by the user in html\_theme\_optionsand are accessible from all templates as theme\_.
 
The **pygments\_dark\_style** setting gives the name of a Pygments style to usefor highlighting when the CSS media query (prefers-color-scheme: dark)evaluates to true. It is injected into the page usingadd\_css\_file().
 
The **options** section contains pairs of variable names and default values.These options can be overridden by the user in html\_theme\_optionsand are accessible from all templates as theme\_.
 
INI-style theme configuration files (theme.conf) can be converted to TOMLvia a helper programme distributed with Sphinx.This is intended for one-time use, and may be removed without notice in a futureversion of Sphinx.
 
To distribute your theme as a Python package, please define an entry pointcalled sphinx.html\_themes in your pyproject.toml file,and write a setup() function to register your themeusing the add\_html\_theme() API:
 
For example, a theme with a static/theme\_styles.css.jinja file could usetemplating to put options into the stylesheet.When a documentation project is built with that theme,the output directory will contain a \_static/theme\_styles.css filewhere all template tags have been processed.
 
By default, Sphinx copies static files on the static/ directory of the templatedirectory. However, if your package needs to place static files outside of thestatic/ directory for some reasons, you need to copy them to the \_static/directory of HTML outputs manually at the build via an event hook. Here is anexample of code to accomplish this:
 
If your extension makes use of JavaScript, it can be useful to allow usersto control its behavior using their Sphinx configuration. However, this canbe difficult to do if your JavaScript comes in the form of a static library(which will not be built with Jinja).
 
First, you may append \_t to the end of any static files included with yourextension. This will cause Sphinx to process these files with the templatingengine, allowing you to embed variables and control behavior.
 
As we just mentioned before, Markdown was originally designed for HTML output, so it may not be surprising that the HTML format has the richest features among all output formats. We recommend that you read this full section before you learn other output formats, because other formats have several features in common with the HTML document format, and we will not repeat these features in the corresponding sections.
 
You can specify the toc\_float option to float the table of contents to the left of the main document content. The floating table of contents will always be visible even when the document is scrolled. For example:
 
You can organize content using tabs by applying the .tabset class attribute to headers within a document. This will cause all sub-headers of the header with the .tabset attribute to appear within tabs rather than as standalone sections. For example:
 
theme specifies the Bootstrap theme to use for the page (themes are drawn from the Bootswatch theme library). Valid themes include default, bootstrap, cerulean, cosmo, darkly, flatly, journal, lumen, paper, readable, sandstone, simplex, spacelab, united, and yeti. Pass null for no theme (in this case you can use the css parameter to add your own styles).
 
highlight specifies the syntax highlighting style. Supported styles include default, tango, pygments, kate, monochrome, espresso, zenburn, haddock, breezedark, and textmate. Pass null to prevent syntax highlighting.
 
smart indicates whether to produce typographically correct output, converting straight quotes to curly quotes, --- to em-dashes, -- to en-dashes, and ... to ellipses. Note that smart is enabled by default.
 
To use a custom function in df\_print within the YAML header, the tag !expr must be used so the R expression after it will be evaluated. See the eval.expr argument on the help page ?yaml::yaml.load for details.
 
When the **knitr** chunk option echo = TRUE is specified (the default behavior), the R source code within chunks is included within the rendered document. In some cases, it may be appropriate to exclude code entirely (echo = FALSE) but in other cases you might want the code to be available but not visible by default.
 
By default, R Markdown produces standalone HTML files with no external dependencies, using da
