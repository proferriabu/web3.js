For once, **Batman** can't seem to defeat his deadly enemy, Failsafe, but one person can: Bruce Wayne. Batman and Bruce Wayne's dual identity has been a key facet of the Batman figure since his debut way back in 1939, but usually the Dark Knight is more useful in a fight than playboy billionaire Bruce Wayne. In recent issues of the Batman title, however, it's become clear that Bruce Wayne has more to offer in his battle with Failsafe than fans may have realized.

Batman's dual identity has been a massive component of his character since the moment he appeared in Detective Comics #27. In that first Batman story, Bruce appears even before the mysterious Batman as the socialite accompanies Commissioner Gordon on a case. Only at the end of the story is Batman revealed to be that seemingly-vapid Bruce. Fast-forward 80 years and Bruce Wayne is still struggling with his sense of self. In recent Batman issues, Batman and his allies are attacked by the relentless and robotic Failsafe, who at first appears to have been created by Batman as his own "failsafe" against himself. Batman and Robin flee to the cave beneath Wayne Manor, where Bruce then disappears into his Batman of Zur-En-Arrh persona. This storyline tells readers that Bruce created the strange persona as another psychic failsafe for himself: a "pure Batman" personality that he can escape into when Bruce Wayne starts to get in his way.
 
Bruce realizes in this moment that Batman isn't only made of strategy and martial ability: Batman's strengths lie in his attachments to other people. As explored elsewhere in this issue, these attachments are what make him imaginative, driven, and a trustworthy ally. So it's no surprise that Tim being put in danger helps Bruce to snap out of the Zur-En-Arrh persona just as much as his realization that Bruce Wayne is just as necessary as "pure Batman." This, of course, is a central theme to the new creative team's run thus far, as it harkens back to Tim Drake's worry in Batman #125 that Batman wasn't spending enough time as Bruce Wayne. Now Bruce emerges from the depths of Batman to save his son.
