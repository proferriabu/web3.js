Currently, the global standard of measurement is the International System of Units (SI), which is a modern form of the metric system. Although SI is intended for global use, it has not been fully adopted, and some other systems of measurement are still used in parts of the world.

The intent of this site is to provide a convenient means to convert between the various units of measurement within different systems, as well as to provide a basic understanding of the systems currently in use, and how they interact. Refer to the Common Unit Systems page for further information.
 
Convert is a free and easy to use unit conversion program that will convert the most popular units of distance, temperature, volume, time, speed, mass, power, density, pressure, energy, and many others, including the ability to create custom conversions!

For a date or time data type expression, style can have one of the values shown in the following table. Other values are processed as 0. Beginning with SQL Server 2012 (11.x), the only styles supported, when converting from date and time types to **datetimeoffset**, are 0 or 1. All other conversion styles return error 9809.
 
By default, SQL Server interprets two-digit years based on a cutoff year of 2049. That means that SQL Server interprets the two-digit year 49 as 2049 and the two-digit year 50 as 1950. Many client applications, including those based on Automation objects, use a cutoff year of 2030. SQL Server provides the two digit year cutoff configuration option to change the cutoff year used by SQL Server. This allows for the consistent treatment of dates. We recommend specifying four-digit years.
 
8 Only supported when casting from character data to **datetime** or **smalldatetime**. When casting character data representing only date or only time components to the **datetime** or **smalldatetime** data types, the unspecified time component is set to 00:00:00.000, and the unspecified date component is set to 1900-01-01.
 
When converting **smalldatetime** to character data, the styles that include seconds or milliseconds show zeros in these positions. When converting from **datetime** or **smalldatetime** values, use an appropriate **char** or **varchar** data type length to truncate unwanted date parts.
 
Implicit conversions don't require specification of either the CAST function or the CONVERT function. Explicit conversions require specification of the CAST function or the CONVERT function. The following illustration shows all explicit and implicit data type conversions allowed for SQL Server system-supplied data types. These include **bigint**, and **sql\_variant**, and **xml**. There is no implicit conversion on assignment from the **sql\_variant** data type, but there is implicit conversion to **sql\_variant**.
 
Because Unicode data always uses an even number of bytes, use caution when you convert **binary** or **varbinary** to or from Unicode supported data types. For example, the following conversion doesn't return a hexadecimal value of 41. It returns a hexadecimal value of 4100:
 
Large-value data types have the same implicit and explicit conversion behavior as their smaller counterparts - specifically, the **nvarchar**, **varbinary**, and **varchar** data types. However, consider the following guidelines:
 
When you explicitly or implicitly cast the **xml** data type to a string or binary data type, the content of the **xml** data type is serialized based on a defined set of rules. For information about these rules, see Define the Serialization of XML Data. For information about conversion from other data types to the **xml** data type, see Create Instances of XML Data.
 
When the CAST or CONVERT functions output a character string, and they receive a character string input, the output has the same collation and collation label as the input. If the input isn't a character string, the output has the default collation of the database, and a collation label of coercible-default. For more information, see Collation Precedence (Transact-SQL).
 
SQL Server guarantees that only roundtrip conversions, in other words conversions that convert a data type from its original data type and back again, yield the same values from version to version. The following example shows such a roundtrip conversion:
 
Don't construct **binary** values, and then convert them to a data type of the numeric data type category. SQL Server does not guarantee that the result of a **decimal** or **numeric** data type conversion, to **binary**, will be the same between versions of SQL Server.
 
1 Conversion of **float** values that use scientific notation to **decimal** or **numeric** is restricted to values of precision 17 digits only. Any value with precision higher than 17 rounds to zero.
 
Starting with SQL Server 2012 (11.x), when using supplementary character (SC) collations, a CAST operation from **nchar** or **nvarchar** to an **nchar** or **nvarchar** type of smaller length won't truncate inside a surrogate pair. Instead, the operation truncates before the supplementary character. For example, the following code fragment leaves @x holding just 'ab'. There isn't enough space to hold the supplementary character.
 
In earlier versions of SQL Server, the default style for CAST and CONVERT operations on **time** and **datetime2** data types is 121, except when either type is used in a computed column expression. For computed columns, the default style is 0. This behavior impacts computed columns when they are created, used in queries involving auto-parameterization, or used in constraint definitions.
 
Under compatibility level 110 and higher, the CAST and CONVERT operations on the **time** and **datetime2** data types always have 121 as the default style. If a query relies on the old behavior, use a compatibility level less than 110, or explicitly specify the 0 style in the affected query.
 
Upgrading the database to compatibility level 110 and higher won't change user data that has been stored to disk. You must manually correct this data as appropriate. For example, if you used SELECT INTO to create a table from a source containing a computed column expression described above, the data (using style 0) would be stored rather than the computed column definition itself. You must manually update this data to match style 121.
 
This example calculates a single column computation (Computed) by dividing the total year-to-date sales (SalesYTD) by the commission percentage (CommissionPCT). This value is rounded to the nearest whole number and is then CAST to an **int** data type.
 
Starting with GETDATE() values, this example displays the current date and time, uses CAST to change the current date and time to a character data type, and then uses CONVERT to display the date and time in the ISO 8601 format.
 
This example is approximately the opposite of the previous example. This example displays a date and time as character data, uses CAST to change the character data to the **datetime** data type, and then uses CONVERT to change the character data to the **datetime** data type.
 
In order to evaluate the expression @notastring + ' is not a string.', SQL Server needs to follow the rules of data type precedence to complete the implicit conversion before the result of the expression can be calculated. Because **int** has a higher precedence than **varchar**, SQL Server attempts to convert the string to an integer and fails because this string can't be converted to an integer.
 
In this case, the string '1' can be converted to the integer value 1, so this SELECT statement will return the value 2. When the data types provided are integers, the + operator becomes addition mathematical operator, rather than a string concatenation.
 
This example retrieves the name of the product for those products that have a 3 in the first digit of their list price, and converts the ListPrice of these products to **int**. It uses the AdventureWorksDW2022 database.
 
This example calculates a single column value by dividing the product unit price (UnitPrice) by the discount percentage (UnitPriceDiscountPct). This result is then rounded to the nearest whole number, and finally converted to an **int** data type. This example uses the AdventureWorksDW2022 database.
 
This example displays the current date and time, uses CAST to change the current date and time to a character data type, and finally uses CONVERT display the date and time in the ISO 8601 format. This example uses the AdventureWorksDW2022 database.
 
This example is the rough opposite of the previous example. This example displays a date and time as character data, uses CAST to change the character data to the **datetime** data type, and then uses CONVERT to change the character data to the **datetime** data type. This example uses the AdventureWorksDW2022 database.
