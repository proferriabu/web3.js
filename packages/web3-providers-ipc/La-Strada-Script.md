it is a well-known fact that all graphic designers wear black, a look enhanced by a polo-neck or turtle-neck jersey in the days of apple's steve jobs. because he was cool. i have no idea if jonny ive wears either black or turtle-necks, but i believe the point is perhaps well-made and likely already laboured to death. though the black look is probably a style choice, in the days prior to computers its history may be more invested in pragmatism. with items such as cow gum, felt tip, rotring and letraset, much like bicycle mechanics, black seems the ideal solution.

but of course, graphic designers are too cool for school, the sort of people blissfully unaffected by events that would elicit a wholly different level of excitement in normal folks. and as thus, it is necessary to cultivate an aura of disdain for anything deigned to be sub-standard, one of which is the use of typefaces that demonstrate a lack of understanding of typography and the uses to which it should be put.
 
though it seems no longer to be a part of the interweb, in my early years of designer affectation and wearing of black (though i stopped short at the polo-neck) there really was a website called 'designers against brush script'. i'm loathe to quote the definition of those who employ this particular typeface in their day to day entrepreneurship because it's considerably less than flattering. but much like the atomic bomb, it's not the device that's inherently bad, it's the folks that press the button.
 
which is a long-winded way of raising my principal objection, superficial though it may be, against previous items of apparel received from switzerland's cervo rosso. in more than just one instance, their otherwise excellent apparel was marred by the words 'it's your ride' placed vertically over the central back pocket. the slogan itself is less than objectionable, but screening it in brush script...?
 
which is why there were celebrations in the croft when the strada 2.0 arrived fresh from the now financially disparaged country of switzerland. rather than any sign of brush script about its person, that central rear pocket (with outboard security zipped version) featured instead a highly admirable logo advising that this comfortable, warm, fleece-lined jersey is swiss cycling apparel. the superficiality of all this can be identified by the fact that when worn, such wording cannot be seen by the pilot.

according to the cervo rosso website, the strada 2.0 is designed for cool weather riding, an appropriateness to which i can readily attest. though outing number one had to be curtailed due to serious crosswinds that threatened to upend both rider and bicycle, weekend number two brought the strada 2.0 to its senses. as i departed the bike shed with flashing lights front and rear, it was snowing rather heavily and the temperature was pretty close to zero but from the wrong side.
 
i cannot deny that, though cool weather is decidedly where it's at, the strada is not really constituted to be worn al fresco in precipitous slushy snow. therefore i augmented my dress code with a cervo rosso outer shell, packing a rain jacket just in case the weather became colder or wetter. true to form, it did both. however, as one layer midst a winter baselayer and two outer layers, the strada proved itself every bit the equal of the weather; toastiness was mine. it's also worth mentioning that pairing the strada with cr's thermal bibshorts and leg warmers was a particularly good choice too.
 
the fleece lining offers a lovely soft smooth interior, and though i figure the collar could bear a few more millimetres of height, at this point in january, i usually wear a merino collar over any jersey in any case. the sleeve length proved to be almost perfectly judged, while the torso was a close, but not spray-on fit, a feature that well behoves any winter jersey.
 
That effort, TypeScript, which was codenamed "Strada" (see more on the codename below), is available in preview form on Microsoft's CodePlex site. The open-source TypeScript compiler and the spec are there, as is a plug-in for Visual Studio.
 
Microsoft has provided a number of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript tooling as part of Internet Explorer (as of version 8). With IE 9, there were even more of these so-called F12 tools for creating, testing and administering IE sites. Microsoft also introduced "Chakra," the JavaScript engine for Internet Explorer, as part of IE 9.
 
The most publicly recognizable name behind TypeScript is Microsoft Technical Fellow Anders Hejlsberg, the father of C# and TurboPascal. But Hejlsberg isn't the one who came up with the idea for TypeScript.
 
TypeScript is actually the product of a team of about 50 people, headed by Microsoft Technical Fellow Steve Lucco. Lucco's title is Chief Architect for Javascript runtime and tools. Lucco led the team of about 30 people or so who built Chakra. According to Lucco's updated bio on LinkedIn (not on Microsoft.com, as Microsoft has removed this year the bios for its Technical Fellows and nearly all other managers from its own Web site), he "started the TypeScript team, co-designed TypeScript and built the first TypeScript compiler."
 
Another key member of the TypeScript team is Program Manager Luke Hoban, who has been working on the JavaScript language and development experience. His current focus is on ECMAScript standards, Internet Explorer JavaScript engine standards support.
 
Yet another notable on the TypeScript team is someone Microsoft officials haven't mentioned in a while. Erich Gamma, a high-profile hire from IBM who joined Microsoft in 2011. Gamma is a Distinguished Engineer in Microsoft Zurich. He used to be the technical lead of IBM's Rational Collaborative Application Life Cycle management work and also the former technical lead of Rational Team Concert. Additionally, he was the original lead of the Eclipse Java development environment and one of the leaders of the Eclipse Project.
 
When he joined Microsoft in 2011, Microsoft officials didn't say exactly what he'd be working on. They did say he'd continue to operate out of Zurich, Switzerland, where Microsoft would be "opening a small Visual Studio development lab with Erich as the lead."
 
It's clear Microsoft was quite serious about bringing typing and manageability to JavaScript, given the high-titled names on the team roster. But as interesting as the "who's" are the "why's" behind the project.
 
Since Microsoft took the public wraps off TypeScript on October 1, there have been plenty of "here we go again with the embrace and extend thing" charges levied against it. Why didn't Microsoft just back Google's Dart instead? (Besides the fact that Dart is attempting to replace JavaScript with a new language and type system, it seems kind of obvious to me Microsoft wouldn't back it, given it's arch-enemy Google's thing, but...) Why not rely Script# or CoffeeScript to make JavaScript programming easier? And does JavaScript really even need static typing, some have asked aloud?
 
As fun (and believable) as some conspiracy theories are, there is a practical side as to why Microsoft jumped into the JavaScript tooling space in a much bigger way. Some Microsoft teams are programming in JavaScript, too.
 
In a Microsoft Channel 9 video posted this week, Hejlsberg, Lucco and Hoban mentioned in passing some of the driving forces behind the company's decision to get into the JavaScript tooling space. It turns out one of the big motivations was the experience of other teams at Microsoft who were attempting to develop and maintain Microsoft products in JavaScript.
 
Lucco cited the Bing Maps team as one that has encountered difficulties in making JavaScript scale. He also mentioned that the TypeScript team has worked with the Office 365 team. (He didn't specify what that team is doing with JavaScript, but it's likely connected to the development of Office Web Apps, the Webified versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.) Hoban said that the TypeScript team also has done work internally with the Microsoft teams building Windows 8 apps -- including, I'd assume, the Bing AppEx team.
 
None of the TypeScript folks in the Channel 9 video mentioned any connection between the TypeScript team and the "Isotope" team that is working on the Windows Azure and Windows Server Hadoop variants. But it wouldn't surprise me if these two groups have or will collaborate, given the coming Microsoft Hadoop flavors will include a "JavaScript framework for Apache Hadoop that will enable JavaScript developers to perform iterative prototyping and interactive exploration of data in Hadoop."
 
What's your take? Do you think Microsoft's decision to create a JavaScript superset was driven by practicality and internal need? By wanting to put its own stamp on JavaScript? Both? Neither?
 
Fellini described *La Strada* as "a complete catalogue of my entire mythological world, a dangerous representation of my identity that was undertaken with no precedent whatsoever".[1] As a result, the film demanded more time and effort than any of his other works, before or later.[2] The development process was long and tortuous; there were problems during production, including insecure financial backing, problematic casting, and numerous delays. Finally, just before the production completed shooting, Fellini suffered a nervous breakdown that required medical treatment so that he could complete principal photography. Initial critical reaction was harsh, and the film's screening at the Venice Film Festival was the occasion of a bitter controversy that escalated into a public brawl between Fellini's supporters and detractors.
 
Subsequently, however, *La Strada* has become "one of the most influential films ever made", according to the American Film Institute.[3] It won
