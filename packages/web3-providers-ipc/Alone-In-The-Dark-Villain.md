Ezechiel Pregzt anchored his ship Astarte near New Orleans, Louisiana. He made a hideout in the swamp there, but ultimately was hanged in 1620 by Welsh Naval conscripts. Several years later, he was reborn as Elijah Pickford. With his new identity, he built Derceto Mansion and lived there until the mansion was burned down at the end of the American Civil War. Pregzt had attempted to possess the body of Union Captain J.W. Norton, who in response shot Pregzt. Now, his spirit lives underneath the mansion, waiting to live again by possessing a living, human host and unleash darkness upon the world. With his powers, he was able to enslave any living and undead being within the confines of the Decerto Mansion. He was only able to possess living bodies, so he was not able to possess Jeremy when he committed suicide. Jeremy Hartwood was the owner of the Derceto Mansion, who was seeing visions of Pregzt that caused him to commit suicide. He was also mentioned at least once in some literature in *Alone in the Dark II*, allegedly having fathered the villain in *Alone in the Dark 3* with the sorceress Elizabeth Jarret, who was incidentally the secondary antagonist of *Alone in the Dark II*.
 
The player gets to fight a ghostly pirate corpse which is actually Pregzt. He can only be killed in a sword duel, although it only destroys his corporeal form. Near the end of the game, you actually see Pregzt in a terrifying second form, looking as if he has been bonded with a tree trunk, expectantly awaiting the player to enter his domain. He summons Deep Ones and fires a slow fire-blast at the player. He is defeated once and for all by removing his magical protection with a Talisman and throwing the lamp at what Pregzt has become, burning and killing him. All the beings enslaved by the evil captain have now disappeared as the house itself seems to tear itself apart.
 
It's been six months since I last explained the theory of the idiot plot, so maybe you won't mind if I have another go. Briefly, an idiot plot depends upon one or more characters being idiots. They get trapped in a situation that they could easily get out of with common sense. But they don't, being idiots. If they did, they'd solve the problem and the movie would be over.
 
Idiot plots usually turn up in bad movies, but occasionally they creep into superior films like this one, causing unhappy distractions. "Wait Until Dark" is about a blind girl (Audrey Hepburn) whose husband accidentally gets possession of a doll containing heroin. After she is left alone in her apartment, three men terrorize her in an attempt to find the doll.
 
They stage an elaborate act in which one plays a cop, one plays an old college chum of her husband and the third plays -- but never mind. The important thing is, these three guys walk in and out of her apartment with complete freedom. The door is unlocked. First one guy comes in. Then he leaves and someone else turns up. Finally the girl realizes she's in danger.
 
So far, so good. We can swallow the first hour of the movie, even though it's rather unlikely, simply because we like to be entertained and want to be convinced. But after the girl wakes up to the danger she's in, why doesn't she LOCK THAT DOOR?
 
She's left alone. The guys are gone for a moment. There's a little girl living upstairs, and Audrey sends her to the bus terminal to wait for her husband's bus. (Another idiot plot slip-up. Why not send the girl to the police?) Then she's alone again. The door is unlocked. But she can lock it. She doesn't.
 
The bad guys come in and out of the apartment like finalists in a revolving door sweepstakes. In the dark privacy of the 19th row, made all the more suspenseful because the lights in the theater are turned out for the last scenes, am I frightened? On the edge of my chair? No, I'm asking myself why she doesn't lock the door.

Otherwise, it's a good movie. I don't want to give the impression that it isn't. Miss Hepburn is perhaps too simple and trusting, and Alan Arkin (as a sadistic killer) is not particularly convincing in an exaggerated performance. But there are some nice, juicy passages of terror (including that famous moment when every adolescent girl in the theater screams), and after a slow start the plot does seduce you. I don't think Audrey Hepburn should have gotten an Academy nomination for her performance (she was much better in "Two for the Road"), but I don't want to quibble. My demands are not great. I just want her to lock that door. Now!
 
While it has many fun and entertaining scenes, it also has plenty of moments that have led to some incredibly dark Home Alone theories. Many aspects of the story, such as Kevin's talent for creating deadly traps and the fact his parents would forget him in the first place, have spawned some interesting ideas about hidden meanings behind Home Alone. Many viewers throughout the years filled in the blanks left by the holiday classic with their own ideas, with the best and darkest Home Alone theories changing the perspective of the Christmas comedy into something much more sinister.
 
Redditor cubanesis came up with a Home Alone theory that suggests Kevin's dad, Peter, might be a criminal. This makes a lot of sense, as the family in Home Alone is shown to be rich, affording a nice house in a high-class neighborhood, and affording plane tickets to France for the whole family. When burglar Harry, disguised as a police officer, shows up, a perplexed Peter asks, "Am I under arrest?"
 
This is a strange reaction to a simple police visit, and has **lead internet users to believe that Peter is a mob boss**, which could also explain his large income. Add in an uncle who seems very dubious and one son who seems completely sadistic, and that the McCallister family may in fact be part of a criminal empire.
 
Uncle Frank is very prominently shown to have a natural hatred for Kevin and jealousy of his brother's income. Luminescence9 speculates on Reddit that Uncle Frank may have hired Harry and Marv to rob the house and make Kevin the prime suspect, as he was the only one alone in the house, making the crime that much more believable.
 
Some who buy into this Home Alone theory even believe that **Uncle Frank had hired the Wet Bandits** to take care of Kevin in the home invasion and leaving him behind was part of his elaborate plan. His greed and visibly prominent twisted personality in the movies, make this theory very palpable and probable, once gone into detail.
 
This Home Alone theory proposes that Peter McCalsiter shares no bond or loving relationship with his son, Kevin, but **rather seeks to, somehow, get rid of him**. The rare interactions between the two in all movies of the series start with Peter scolding Kevin. "Kevin's family was absolutely emotionally abusive," Griffer00 explained on Reddit. And the second movie starts with Peter, very suspiciously, leaving Kevin behind, on purpose, in the airport. These scenarios in the movies further form evidence of this extremely probable theory, which is not as far-fetched as it would seem at first glance.
 
This is why Marley can help Kevin ever so easily, and always seems to be in the right place just when Kevin needs him most. This Home Alone theory explains that Kevin/Marly had family issues in the future caused by the events of the film and wanted to prevent present-day Kevin from driving a wedge between his family and save himself from the lonely life he'd experienced, creating a fun time travel paradox.
 
So for the sake of temporarily saving face he chooses to throw her to the dogs. They are a bizarrely matched couple, given her intellectual life and his seeming lack of interests, but they are portrayed as a loving one, and any kind and caring partner would have sat Rachel down and discussed with her what she was letting herself in for. Or rather what he was letting her in for. There would still have been the eventual questions about her upbringing to overcome, but to be forewarned is to be forearmed, and only a villain would deny Rachel the opportunity to psychologically prepare for battle.
 
To make matters worse, when they get to Singapore he proceeds to abandon her as often as possible. Yes, she wants to see Peik Lin, and yes he has wedding duties to attend to, but does he really need to leave her alone quite as much as he does? She is thrown in at the deep end and left to flounder. Cousin Astrid pays more attention than Nick, which is damning given that she has tough trouble in her own life to deal with.
 
\*Hooked is a full-length, complete standalone and the first in The Never After Series: A collection of fractured fairy tales where the villains get the happy ever after. This is a DARK Contemporary romance (not fantasy) featuring mature themes and content that may not be suitable for all audiences. Reader discretion is advised.
 
I actually loved this book. My friend let me borrow their copy and I wanted to read it again so I got my own. I almost never reread books but I loved the plot and and how this story was told. An absolutely amazing book. 10/10
 
Most people may not want to be identified as a villain for its evil connotations, but depending on what stage you are in your **shadow work**, and whether or not you accept that we all have a dark side, you will be completely fine with this.
 
As you can imagine, not everyone will be happy with you when you start setting firm boundaries. I mean if people are used to getting over on you for years, taking that supply can feel like a threat to their survival.
