We all know that Bobby Prince utilized a lot of stock sound effects for Doom, most of which are from the sound libraries from Sound Ideas. However, every source can't be traced for all the sound effects in Doom & Doom II, and their sources are probably lost to time, unless you can find any out of print Sound Ideas libraries on CD-ROMs containing higher quality versions of these sound effects, with most of them not being available on Internet Archive and other abandonware sites.
 
So, it's possible that most of the stock sound effects used for Doom's audio files are no longer available for licensing, unless your able to track down older CD-ROMs from Sound Ideas on either eBay or Amazon. It's kind of similar to how many of the stock photos from Corbis, Photodisc & Getty Images used as the basis for the desktop wallpapers for Windows 2000 until Windows 10 aren't available for licensing anymore.

I've still got my fingers crossed that one day we'll find out where the HOOOOOOOOOO!! sound comes from (the Baron wakeup sound). Since it hasn't been found yet in sample libraries, and it sounds unlike anything on the planet, I suspect it was frankensteined out of unsourceable parts.
 
Considering the fact that animal sounds are used for other enemies, I think that's also the case with the Baron, even if it didn't come from that specific library. Always sounded more like an elephant to me. With that (citation needed), I guess we'll never know The Truth.

The absolutely specific CD-ROM(s) that Prince used to source the sound effects would probably be difficult for you to find, but the overwhelming majority of Doom's sound design consists of heavily-edited (and frankly ancient at this point) stock sound effects. These stock sound effects are definitely not "lost to time" because many of them can be heard all over the damn place across various media for the past 4 decades at this point. You've likely already heard the source sounds for Doom's sound design a thousand times before across many movies, televisions shows and games you've experienced in your life and never noticed!
 
The original Sound Ideas 6000 library used for a lot of Doom's sounds is still very much available for sale, provided you've got US$500 and 50gb of disc space to spare. The other libraries listed on the Doom Wiki page are also still available, often on that same site.
 
I'm sure that after a while of describing what the unsourced sounds are like we'll be able to check sound libraries for those kinds of sounds

For example, I think the Revenant Roaming sound is like a car passing by, thus we should try checking that library
 
Bobby Prince gathered his best field equipment and went out for months to record the threat, mating, maternal etc. calls of the demons in their respective natural habitats. Same way Adrian got the animation frames.

I mean, these guys have collected 7500 (as mentioned by Kinsie, weighing in at 50GB) samples of all sorts of things all over the world. Animal sounds. Machinery sounds of all different kinds. Vehicles of all sorts. Nature sounds. I can't imagine that was anything less than a staggering amount of work. It's also aimed at professionals, where $500 is probably just a tiny drop in the budget of things it's being used in, including something like Doom.
 
That's amazing. 12:07, the Lost Soul apparently was planned to have its own death sound, and the remnant lump for it is a duplicate of the Doomguy oomph sound. In the SNES version, Lost Souls make the oomph sound when killed, so I wonder if the devs found the death sound lump and just used it.

Yes, I have heard them numerous times. It always triggers a reaction in me. I could be focused on something entirely and my lady is watching TV and suddenly I hear the Doom door noise and my attention immediately switches to the noise source. Doom and everything about it really is muscle memory at this point.
 
Funny how many of these I knew were stock sounds, but also how many also were but I didn't recognize at first. A while back I was editing a recorded playthrough of some level and fast-forwarded through a part at 2x speed, and when some zombies were getting shot in the footage I heard the sped-up hurt noise and was like "wait what, I know that scream!" Imagining imps with that noise at the original pitch and screaming like a normal human is a pretty funny image, I must say.
 
Because you pay a one time fee for the license to use their sound library, then you're free to use it as much as you'd ever like to for all your productions. $500 for 7500 sound effects of staggering variety I think is a pretty good deal. Don't know if it had a higher price in the past.
 
In the meantime, can anyone here extract the sound effects from Sound Ideas Sound Effects Demo videos, minus the voice overs, and create mock-up versions of what most of the original sources these stock sound effects for Doom's Sound effects could've sounded like.
 
The Mancubus' pain sound is Elmer Fudd saying "quiet" but slowed down/downpitched. Bobby Prince doesn't remember using it as a source, and indeed it may have been accidental somehow, but at the end of the day the sounds are **clearly** one and the same. Link:
 
"[Bobby] speculates it is possible a sound clip labeled as an animal or a monster was an already altered Fudd." - to me, this seems like the most plausible reason. Whoever compiled the sound library in the first place somehow added Elmer Fudd in there, and Bobby heard the (already altered?) sound and thought it fit well.
 
I know a (somewhat) better method for this. Sound Ideas' SourceAudio website contains the vast majority of their sound libraries, and you can have it specifically list all the SFX from a certain library (such as, for example, the Series 6000). Better yet, it allows you to listen to the sounds without having to buy their respective library. It helped me a bunch when I was trying to ID a bunch of stock sounds used in Animation Magic's Zelda games.
 
The companies behind these outdated legacy libraries are basically a remnant of the old SFX library market from the 90s where there were only a handful of them around and they had a complete stranglehold on the market, and pretty much only sold to professional studios rather than freelancers or hobbyists, and so they priced their products accordingly. The market is very different today with many more options at both higher quality and better price points, but the old companies have been basically operating the same way as back when they had no competition and are probably just running on momentum. Frankly, I'm surprised Sound Ideas has even updated their website cause I checked it just a couple of years ago and it still looked web 1.0 as hell, as is usually the case with these types of dinosaurs.
