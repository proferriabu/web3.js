As far as I can tell, most of those tools (certainly After the Deadline and LanguageTool) are rule based. The checked text is compared with a large set of rules describing common errors. If a rule matches, the software calls it an error. If a rule does not match, the software does nothing (it cannot detect errors it does not have rules for).
 
Check out NLTK. They have support for grammars that you can use to parse your sentence. You can define a grammar, or use one that is provided, along with a context-free parser. If the sentence parses, then it has valid grammar; if not, then it doesn't. These grammars may not have the widest coverage (eg, it might not know how to handle a word like StackOverflow), but this approach will allow you to say specifically what is valid or invalid in the grammar. Chapter 8 of the NLTK book covers parsing and should explain what you need to know.
 
An alternative would be to write a python interface to a wide-coverage parser (like the Stanford parser or C&C). These are statistical parsers that will be able to understand sentences even if they haven't seen all the words or all the grammatical constructions before. The downside is that sometimes the parser will still return a parse for a sentence with bad grammar because it will use the statistics to make the best guess possible.
 
So, it really depends on exactly what your goal is. If you want very precise control over what is considered grammatical, use a context-free parser with NLTK. If you want robustness and wide-coverage, use a statistical parser.
 
I recommend language\_tool\_python, a grammar checker that supports Python 3 and the latest versions of Java and LanguageTool. It's the only up-to-date, free Python grammar checker. (full disclosure, I made this library)
 
For more accurate and specialized grammar and spell-checking, you can consider using dedicated libraries and tools such as pyaspeller, pyspellchecker, or language-tool-python. These libraries are specifically designed for grammar and spell-checking tasks and may provide better accuracy compared to a general-purpose language model like GPT-3.
 
Despite the success and widespread adoption of smartphones, using them to compose longer pieces of text is still quite cumbersome. As one writes, grammatical errors can often creep into the text (especially undesirable in formal situations), and correcting these errors can be time consuming on a small display with limited controls.
