The CONTENTdm Website Configuration Tool offers a large number of configuration options and settings that require no knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. However, the Website Configuration Tool also gives you various upload dialogs to add your own HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files to modify the CONTENTdm website UI and create your own advanced UI customizations.
 
If you are familiar with customizing the 6.x CONTENTdm website, the new responsive CONTENTdm website handles advanced customizations in a very different way. The new responsive UI is built on the React JavaScript framework. There is no PHP or jQuery involved in the new website. This means your customizations need to rely largely on CSS and JavaScript.

Problem: I am struggling with getting 1 new image to display on the Access Policy Logon page. The goal is not trying to replace the existing header logo image, but rather ADD a new image in the footer. I did the following: \* Uploaded gif using the APM "Image Browser" tool \* Established link between "image09" and the gif through "Advanced Customization Images" \* Edited the Common/footer.inc file to reference the gif:
 
Result: The logon page appears with a box indicating that it sees/recognizes the newly inserted code. But it doesn't show the actual gif. Inspecting the element shows that it inline translated the gif properly to: /public/images/customization/Common/service.name\_ap\_general\_ui/image09\_en.gif

You can perform most tasks on Whatfix using the Whatfix user interface. For tasks that are not as frequently used, you can use certain snippets of code to perform advanced actions using Whatfix. Each action can be enabled by copying the respective code into the Advanced Customization window as explained below.
 
Most customization requirements for the Connect apps can be implemented by using the Pexip branding portal to generate a package of branding files and then applying that branding by uploading the branding package to the Management Node (see Customizing and branding the Connect apps). However, for advanced customization requirements you may need to make manual changes to the branding files.
 
You may also need to manually customize these files if you are hosting the web app on an external server or reverse proxy. For information about how to apply customized branding in this situation, see Hosting the web app externally.

The standard method for applying branding to the Pexip Infinity platform is to upload a branding package to the Management Node and associating the package with a unique web app path. The package is then pushed out to all Conferencing Nodes, from where those customizations are served to all web app users joining using that path.
 
Branding customizations that are applied to the Connect web app via the Management Node will persist over upgrades to subsequent versions of Pexip Infinity software (although you may need to adapt the customization to cater for any new features when upgrading to a new major release).
 
This section describes how to manually customize the latest web app, Connect Webapp3. You do this by manually creating a client branding package, uploading it to the Management Node, and then specifying the web app path used to access the branding.
 
The manifest.json file controls which customized settings take effect, and which image files are used. When customizing Webapp3, you must include the manifest.json file in the webapp3/branding folder (creating it, if necessary, in the first instance).
 
specifies the path of the content that appears within the card. The content can be an HTML file, text, an image, a video, or anything else that can be displayed inside an iframe. For more details and examples, see Body of the custom step.
 
You must define a default path, and you can optionally define additional paths on a per-language basis. The default path will be used unless the user's browser's display language is set to one of the defined languages, in which case the path specified by that language will be used.
 
Determines whether the "terms and conditions of use" text (as defined in the language file by "next-terms-and-conditions") is shown on the user name step of the join flow. This option is enabled by default; to disable it set
 
Specifies the URL to which the "terms and conditions" text on the user name step of the join flow is directed. By default, this is You can change this for all users, or you can specify different URLs depending on the user's browser language. For example:
 
To find the data-testid of an element, right-click on the element and select Inspect. From the panel on the right select the Elements tab. The code expands to show the definition of the element; from within this find the data-testid and copy the value.
 
When creating a branding package, you can save your images within the webapp3/branding folder or you can create a subfolder within it (e.g. webapp3/branding/images) and save your images there. Either way, when you then reference those images from within the manifest.json you must reference the image's location as follows:
 
You can optionally include a background image file to display behind all other elements on the landing page. To do this, save the file you wish to use in the webapp3/branding folder and then edit the manifest.json to specify its path using the "background" property within the "images" property.
 
To specify different images used depending on the screen size / breakpoints, use an object with the properties xs, sm, md, lg, and xl. The properties represent breakpoints; each property value is a string that contains the URL of the image displayed at that specific breakpoint.
 
At least 1 breakpoint property should be defined on the object, but not all need be set. If just the xs and md breakpoints are set, the breakpoint in between (sm) will use the larger (md) image. If the larger breakpoints above md are not set, they will fallback to using the md image.
 
To include default background replacement images for all users in your deployment, save the files you wish to use in the webapp3/branding folder (or a subfolder that you create) and then edit the manifest.json to specify the path of each image using the "bgImageAssets" value within the applicationConfig section.
 
Connect Webapp3 supports over 20 of the most popular languages. If the user's browser is set to use any one of these supported languages, Connect Webapp3 will use that automatically instead of the default English. Alternatively, users can view Connect Webapp3 in any of the supported languages by appending the appropriate language code to the end of the URL.
 
You can change any of the text that is displayed in the application (either in the default English or any of the supported languages), and you can add additional languages. Each language references a .json dictionary file containing a list of token and text string pairs.
 
Each language file contains a list of token and text string pairs. The token remains the same in all language files and the associated string contains the text that is displayed in the app when that language file is used.
 
The full set of token and text string pairs for each supported language is available from \_languages/v34/.json where is the ISO standard code for the language. For example, the link for the default English file is \_languages/v34/en.json. You can download this file to use as the basis of your new or edited language files (you may need to right-click and select Save link as...).
 
To change the text that is displayed, simply search in the language file for the text that needs to be changed, edit the text string, and save your changes back to the same file. Do not change the token names.
 
For example, in the default en.json the "Please enter a display name so other people know who's in the meeting" string is located in the "username" block and is associated with the "usage-purpose" token:
 
The strings are generally grouped together according to where or when they are displayed. For example, all tokens in the "add-participant" block refer to strings that appear when you are adding a participant to the meeting.
 
The edited language file does not have to contain the complete set of tokens / text strings. You only need to include the token and text string pairs that you want to be different from the default strings for that language.
 
You can use your own alternative English strings instead of the default strings. To do this, download the default en.json file from \_languages/v34/en.json (you may need to right-click and select Save link as...), and edit the strings as required. You only need to include the token and text string pairs that you want to be different from the default strings. Do not change the token names.
 
We recommend using the ISO standard language codes/locales for the filename as this allows that language file to be used automatically if its name matches the browser's default language. Always use **.json** as the filename extension.
 
This message appears when a user disconnects a participant. In this case, the application automatically substitutes userName with the participant's actual name as shown in the participant list. Variables always take the format . You cannot create your own va
