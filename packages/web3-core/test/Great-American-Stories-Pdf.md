This week, The Atlantic published a new list of \u201CThe Great American Novels.\u201D It\u2019s full of both expected classics as well as both good and/or weird surprises. There is no way to do these lists without the former and no point in doing them without the latter. Overall, I think The Atlantic did a fine job. I appreciated the inclusion of graphic novels (Sabrina and Watchmen) and especially the genre books. Certainly novels like Chandler\u2019s The Big Sleep, Le Guin\u2019s The Dispossessed, Butler\u2019s Kindred, and Jackson\u2019s The Haunting of Hill House deserve spots. What\u2019s American literature without science fiction, horror, and hardboiled detective fiction? Excluding them would be like excluding Westerns and rom coms from a list of Great American Movies.
 
Yes, I get that the list was restricted to novels. That\u2019s fine and good. But reading the article made me think about how central the short story is to American literature. Indeed, it might be the quintessential American literary form. (I was hardly the only person to think along these lines: Amber Sparks, Sterling HolyWhiteMountain, Aaron Burch, and others had similar thoughts.)

Hell, does it make sense to put writers like George Saunders, Joy Williams, Annie Proulx, and Jhumpa Lahiri on here for novels that\u2014great as they might be\u2014are not as good or influential as their story collections? A Great American Fiction list would, I think, instead list Pastoralia (or perhaps Tenth of December), Taking Care, Close Range, and Interpreter of Maladies, respectively.
 
This is really less a critique of The Atlantic\u2019s list than a thought about American literature in general and perhaps a lament for the declining role of the short story. Because it is hard not to notice the shrinking prestige of short stories, even as the form is as vibrant and alive as ever in American letters.
 
Part of this has nothing to do with literature, per se. The past few decades have seen the much-discussed destruction of American magazines and newspapers. Many have disappeared and those that survive depend on online clicks. There\u2019s not much space for short stories, and even less money for short story authors.
 
But there are other factors. I often wonder what things would look like if the big literary awards followed the lead of the genre awards\u2014such as the Hugo and Nebula\u2014and included short story categories. The National Book Awards and Pulitzers command attention, readership, and press coverage. Short story collections theoretically compete for the Fiction category, but in practice almost never win. In my lifetime, only two straight story collections (A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain and Interpreter of Maladies) have won the Pulitzer for example.
 
I do have to shout out The Story Prize here, but I believe the short story is a unique enough form to merit it's own award categories in the biggest awards. It\u2019s as distinct a category as Young People\u2019s Literature and Poetry (to pick NBA categories) and certainly as distinct as the multiple Pulitzer non-fiction book categories (to say nothing of the many journalism awards).
 
Another problem for the short story is that big publishers have increasingly decided not to publish them. It used to be quite common to start your career with a two-book deal, one story collection and one novel. Back then, there was an idea an author would stay with a publisher and that publisher would build their whole career. Today, it\u2019s more common for the big publishers to allow authors\u2014who still write and love short stories\u2014to have a collection on a small press and then snatch them up for a novel. (This is part of why some call small and indie presses the \u201Cminor leagues\u201D that the big publishers poach for talent.)
 
There is doom loop aspect here. Because big publishers don\u2019t publish stories as often, they don\u2019t have big publicity behind. Because short stories are not awarded as often, they do not get the coverage that awards bring. Because they don\u2019t have the publicity dollars or awards coverage\u2014and tend to get left off listicles\u2014they don\u2019t sell as many copies. Thus justifying not publishing, awarding, or listing them.
 
I honestly believe there is more appetite for short stories than publishers might realize. In recent years, books like Carmen Maria Machado\u2019s Her Body and Other Parties and Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah\u2019s Friday Black have been break-out hits and sold plenty of copies. And, while I don\u2019t want to call any authors out, increasingly many \u201Cnovels\u201D are simply lightly fixed-up short story collections. Publishers and readers seem to simply want to see the word \u201Cnovel\u201D on the manuscript even if it is a bunch of stories. (Ditto novellas, a category that has functionally disappeared as publishers simply put them out as \u201Cnovels.\u201D) Hell, one might even argue a few of The Atlantic\u2019s picks like A Visit from the Goon Squad are, in truth, a bunch of short stories in a novel trench coat.
 
Americans have overcome many challenges throughout our history, including the American Revolution, the Civil War, the Great Depression, two World Wars, and the Cold War. Studying the great stories from our past inspires us to preserve the blessings of liberty in our day. Now you can study these stories with Hillsdale College.
 
It's refreshing listening to ideas and thoughts that would be discussed in a classroom setting. It's been quite a few years since I have been in that type of setting. It's nice to be back. It gets the creative juices running in the brain again.
 
A new weekly radio show debuts today on 89.9 Jazz & More, examining the great stories of Jazz across America and the people who create it. Produced by WUCF FM 89.9 Jazz & More and hosted by University of Central Florida Director of Jazz Studies Jeff Rupert, ***Jazz and the American Spirit*** will air Monday nights at 7 p.m.
 
In this one-hour weekly program, Rupert, a saxophonist, composer, record producer, and recording artist himself, will tell the stories of how jazz is deeply connected to conveying the history of America, and demonstrate how jazz can tell the story better than actual words.
 
They had flown from Florida, after Ramos had fallen hopelessly behind on the mortgage for her three-bedroom home, to this family-owned patch of rural land on Hawaii's Big Island. There, on a July night in 2009, they pitched a tent and, with no electricity, started a new life.
 
The story of how she ended up in a tent is the story of how America ended up in a foreclosure crisis that has not ended, that still drags down the economy and threatens to force millions of families from their homes. Already, banks have foreclosed on more than 4 million homes since the crisis began in 2007. With almost 6 million loans still in danger of foreclosure, 2012 could very well be the worst year yet. Ramos' story is remarkable not because it's unique but because it isn't.
 
Her story doesn't fit any of the conventional narratives. Ramos is not a helpless victim. She made mistakes. But she didn't take out her mortgages to splurge on luxuries or build a new wing for her house. She took out her first mortgage to live the free-market dream of starting her own business. She took out later mortgages to cope with injuries sustained in a car accident.
 
Even then, the federal government, facing an electorate bitterly divided over how and even whether to help "irresponsible" homeowners, responded in ways that proved ineffective. To be sure, the government's efforts were unprecedented, as Obama administration officials have repeatedly insisted. But those efforts were also halfhearted. Only recently, after the banks admitted to widespread law-breaking, did the government launch a response that might prove commensurate with the calamity.
 
Born Sheila Ferguson, Ramos was one of seven children. The family lived in the small town of Haiku on the island of Maui, where her father did maintenance work at state parks. At 17, she married a man she'd met in high school, dropped out of school and had two sons, but divorced when she was just 19. She kept his surname, Ramos, but wanted a new life. Maui suddenly seemed small and confining, and she wanted "to get off the rock," as she puts it. So she took her two sons, aged 2 and 3, and left for Alaska.
 
What came next was another reinvention. Her partner, Backus, was an electrician with a side business building large concrete vaults that house electrical equipment. Ramos began dabbling with the concrete, mixing and pouring it to make stepping stones for her garden, then planters for small trees. Soon she'd taken charge of the business and landed a contract to supply an Anchorage electric company with the utility vaults. Working in a small warehouse behind the Anchorage house she shared with Backus, she managed two employees as they mixed gravel, cement and water, poured the mixture into 1-ton forms, and moved them to a truck to be delivered.
 
Ramos laughs when she recalls the amazement of friends and family at how she'd exchanged business suits and high heels for old sweatpants and rubber boots. "It broke my heart to give up those suits," she says, but jokes that she'd just traded slinging one type of mud for another.
 
She gained custody of her three young grandchildren after one of her sons and his wife were imprisoned on drug-related charges. Around the same time, her father had begun suffering from Alzheimer's, so her parents moved in. A frien
