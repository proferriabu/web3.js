After you have completed the scenario, the ACLS simulator will grade your test, and you will receive instant feedback. This will help reinforce the ACLS Algorithm and improve your ability to respond in emergency situations. Go through each megacode scenario as many times as you need to achieve mastery of the ACLS Algorithms.

Can you check question 3 on megacode scenario 4, if you select amio and adensoine it says its wrong and selects procainamide as the correct choice, if you select procainamide it says adenosine and amio are correct???

Jeff thanks for running such a great site and helping me get through a.c.l.s. yet again. Each year your site improves and my first move when knowing a.c.l.s. Is coming is to sign up with you!
Best regards

After getting all the algorithms rights, learn the dosages of medications used, Megacodes show what you need to in simulated situations.
How can one improve further?
Suggestions are welcome.
This is a great site to learn and practice.
Thank you, Jeff
 
Hi Ryan,
Everything on the site is geared around by phasic defibrillator use. Any mention of Monophasic defibrillator is just for reference. always assume the use of a biphasic defibrillator for scenarios on this site. Kind regards, Jeff
 
This website helped me so much I used it a lot for my paramedic course. It really helped to have multiple scenarios to study and to have ECG strips all with easy access! Definitely going to continue studying here on this site! Thank you for all the help!
 
Very helpful in preparing me for my re-certification coming up this week ! It would be helpful if each megacode scenario was also titled as to what it actually is in order to quickly toggle back and forth between your site and the AHA site.

**Mega Man: The Sequel Wars**is a fan-made homebrew remake of Mega Man 4, 5 and 6 for the Sega Mega Drive, following in the footsteps of the officially released Mega Man: The Wily Wars. It aims to carefully recreate the NES classics while giving them a fresh 16-bit coat of paint and a rearranged soundtrack. It also aims to improve on the foundation of Wily Wars by enhancing both the presentation and gameplay.
 
**Episode Red** is the first release of the project, containing the full remake of **Mega Man 4**. Alongside the original game's content, a slew of new features are added to spice up the experience for returning players.
 
**NOTE:**this is **not**a rom hack of Wily Wars! It is fully coded from scratch in C using the SGDK library. As such, the game will be distributed as full ROM releases as there is no original game to patch to.
 
wanted to give my thoughts here. First of all I really dislike being forced to use the variable weapon system as roll. flash mans weapon is okay, but the VWS just feels bad and even worse when the final bosses require it to take damage. Roll is meant to be a melee attacking option, and theres no real gameplay difference in her niche when she is just going to be using the VWS. on the other hand, I strongly liked your effort put in balancing her. I played on double damage mode for her, wile giving her some spike resistance. it makes sense to me that she should be as weak as protoman, though I guess i understand the decision to allow a melee attacker to take more damage. her roll swing felt a little busted, but it was fun being able to enjoy a hard roll game that didn't expect shattered diamond kaizo megaman level memorization. neither did it also feel like perfect blue or megamaker where roll swing was just completely busted. there seems to be a lot of variable opinions on how to do roll right and yet I find myself not happy with any of them particularly. I prefer megamaker roll's shadow dash, though I would have liked for it to use an energy bar for it's prevasion effect. I prefer this games range for rolls swing behavior. and I preferred shattered diamond for the down attack and its lateral height extending mobility although the hit detection in that game is offensively narrow which demands too much dexterity. and basically all of them use the variable weapons system instead of omitting it or giving her alternate techniques. out of all of them though the sequel wars was the most fun for me. 

 
Just wanted to join the choir in praise of this project. Amazing work! The second Mega Man trilogy (4-5-6) is awesome and gets overlooked just because it was "more of the same", but it's actually superior to the originals. You're doing it justice!
 
This IS AWESOME: New Visual Tweaks, New playable characters, new game style, and all in WILY WARS STYLE! Thanks for this experience, I saw the MMSW: Episode blue trailer, if you need any testers contact me on my discord as "zamaxo\_2009"
 
Easily going to be the way I default to playing MM4-6 when it is completed, because MM4 was my favourite and even playing the SAGE and Episode Red demos, I couldn't get enough. I am so stoked for the next two episodes/conversions, because oh my goodness this is something I've been hoping someone would do FOR YEARS!

 
Really impressed with this. Really well done and brought back a lot of fond memories. Lots of great developers out there making some truly great Mega Man games (and then again there are some bad ones...)

 
Hello, I'm playing the Mega Man The Sequel Wars Episode Red v1\_1.bin and for the second time in the Dr Cossack castle the game crashed, I'm going to play another time and record to see if I can recreate the moment when this happened.


 
I played Wily Wars since I was a kid on my Mega Drive, and that's how I got to know the original trilogy, but in my country Argentina, the Sega country par excellence. And now to be able to play this, it's a trip to the past, tested on my Model 1 (Pal-N) and it works correctly. Thanks a lot.
 
Hey, I've encountered a wild softlock when playing Roll vs Wily Machine attempting a basic weapon only run.
I remember I entered Wily fight, defeated the machine with the broom and the game softlocked, leaving just the big skull part on the screen and nothing else. Game was not reacting to my input.
(I dunno if it's relevant, but I remember I also paused and unpaused once before the fight)
Settings: Difficulty hard, infinite lives, disabled boss intros, default the rest.

Besides, is Roll's buster shot riffle lower than Megaman's? Because my friend reported that hitting phase 2's weak point was way harder as Roll.
 
It's Amazing. Awesome Genesis Pallettes. Hopefully I Bet There Will Be a Power Battle Fighters Difficulty And or A Mode After All 3 Games & Wily Tower 2 (if it's there) Are Completed As a True Mega Man Fan.
 
I've already played and finished with the 3 characters this bad ass game in my girlfriend's PS3. Yet I'd like to ask for a request. Can you please make in the options that you can choose the pet partner for Megaman/Roll? So you can play also with Megaman/Tango and Roll/Rush. Thanks.
 
Anyone know why this does not work properly on an Analogue Mega SG? The game boots up, but there's no audio at all. Just a few bleeps and bloops. I am using a Mega Everdrive X5 cart. It plays fine on my model 2 original Genny. Thanks!
 
Very lovely remake of the NES original. Our German-language review can be found in our recorded livestream starting at 05:20:09. Automatic subtitles should be available soon (switch on, if necessary). Subscription to our YouTube or Twitch channel is welcome. ?
