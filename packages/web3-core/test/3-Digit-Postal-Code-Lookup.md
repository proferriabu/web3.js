Also called plus-four codes, 9-digit ZIP Codes, and full ZIP Codes, you can look up USPS ZIP+4 Codes using various tools. Smarty provides some easy-to-use options for single ZIP+4 Code lookups by address, ZIP+4 Codes in bulk (up to millions at a time), and ZIP plus 4 lookup via API. You can try them out here, or read on to learn more about ZIP+4 Codes.

ZIP+4 Codes are 4-digit codes appended to the original 5-digit USPS ZIP Codes. Using the full ZIP Code with the extra 4 digits when mailing via the USPS ensures the fastest, most accurate mailing possible.
 
ZIP plus 4 lookup tools don't just do a full ZIP Code lookup. Before you get the +4 Code, your address is taken through the full address standardization and validation process confirm the address is mailable.
 
These codes indicate a specific delivery route, meaning the actual path the mail truck would travel in a single drop-off. Usually, this comprises 5 to 20 homes or locations. The USPS also assigns ZIP+4 Codes to PO Boxes. Typically, each PO Box gets its own +4 Code, which often matches the box number.
 
The extra 4 digits on ZIP Codes identify segments of fluid postal delivery routes. They're not permanent lines, so a 9 digits ZIP Code can change regularly. Five-digit ZIP Codes also change, but they do so infrequently; it's less likely that you will live in a ZIP Code when it changes. Not so for the last 4 digits of Zip Code numbers.
 
The +4 on a ZIP Code can change as frequently as every 30 days. In fact, 5% of all addresses get their ZIP+4 Code changed each month. Quantity of postal employees, new construction, remapping delivery areas, etc., are just a few things that cause ZIP+4 Code changes.
 
Those benefits are just the beginning. If you're getting the ZIP+4 Code, you're already validating and standardizing the address and address validation improve business results across all types of organizations. Read our ebook to learn how:
 
The Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) was something the USPS came up with to make it easier to ship letters and packages across the country. ZIP helps divide the country into different "zones" according to the distribution of mail, which accelerates sorting and delivery.

On July 1, 1963, the Post Office Department launched the Zone Improvement Plan. At the same time, they introduced the world to Mr. ZIP or "Zippy." Zippy is the official ZIP Code mascot pictured on our ZIP Codes 101 page. They also released the ZIP Code jingle:
 
As the US population has increased and scattered since 1963, it's been necessary to expand the system to make room for everybody and their dog. That's where the "plus 4" part comes in. We're getting ahead of ourselves, so let's start with the basics.
 
If you're mailing a letter from Boston to Seattle, the mail carrier in Massachusetts doesn't care what the street address of the destination is. It's what you might call "outside his jurisdiction." He just needs to know which mail carrier to send it to so the appropriate mail carrier can get it to the address.
 
A postal worker can only cover so much ground on a given day. And since the USPS has a standard of delivering in the rain, sleet, or snow, that rules out the possibility of doing the service of delivery in stages (some today, some tomorrow). That means any given post office only serves what it can reach in a day. ZIP Codes reflect that.
 
Typically, a ZIP Code ties to a post office; by that, we mean every one of the latter has one of the former. You might think of ZIP Codes as a mailing address for a particular post office. Some handle more than one ZIP Code, but a one-on-one game plan is a standard.
 
It's essential to note that ZIP Codes aren't "boundaries." They're a collection of delivery routes. They don't follow geographic or administrative boundary lines; they can cross city, county, and state lines. They follow where the delivery trucks go.
 
Some ZIP Codes are a bit different in function. Among them are "military" ZIP Codes, which include everything from military bases (domestic or otherwise) to battleships at sea. Then there are "unique" ZIP Codes. Businesses and organizations sometimes get a dedicated ZIP Code that they don't have to share with anyone due to the volume of mail they send and receive.
 
These frequently benefit from bulk mailing discounts since the organization usually has a mail department that (1) presorts mail before giving it to the USPS and (2) distributes mail internally, so the USPS doesn't have to. Like standard ZIP Codes, "military" and "unique" ZIP Codes circumscribe their delivery area. For a more in-depth guide, visit our ZIP Codes page.
 
For many users, the best way to access the USPS ZIP+4 database is through a CASS Certified USPS address validation vendor. Like Smarty. Since the last four digits of ZIP Codes update frequently, even month-old data isn't reliable. Checking addresses regularly against the database will ensure your data remains clean.
 
The ZIP+4 Code database can be accessed free directly through the USPS site or the USPS address validation API. In our USPS APIs article, you will find a comprehensive list of uses and limitations of the USPS web-based tool and API. If you need a ZIP+4 Code Database, address validation might scratch your itch better than anything provided by the USPS. You can check out our ebook. It shows how to improve business results in your organization using address validation. Read it here:
 
If you need an answer to, "What is my ZIP Code with the extra 4 digits?" Just click one of the buttons at the top of the page, enter your address, and get your +4 Code instantly. Just remember, it's called a ZIP+4 Code, or simply a ZIP+4.
 
If you want to try it on a single address, you can now use our Single Address Verification Tool. Our blindingly fast US Address Verification API provides the appropriate ZIP+4 Code for every address we process.
 
Or you could call us instead if you'd rather talk to an actual person. (We'd offer a fake person, but we don't have one of those on staff.) Either way, we can help you ZIP your address and ZIP it well.
 
**ZIP+4 Codes** are an extension of the traditional 5-digit ZIP codes used by the USPS, providing a more precise way to identify specific groups of delivery points within a given ZIP code. Each ZIP+4 code can represent a range of delivery points, such as a block of apartments or a group of businesses, as well as individual delivery points.
 
ZIP+4 codes, also known as Plus-Four codes, ZIP code extensions, 9 digit ZIP codes, extended ZIP codes, or full ZIP codes, are four-digit codes that are appended to the traditional five-digit USPS ZIP codes. When used in conjunction with the full ZIP code, the additional four digits allow for more accurate and efficient mail delivery.
 
Each ZIP+4 code represents a specific delivery route, which typically includes 10 to 20 homes or locations. These routes are not permanent and can change regularly, making the last four digits of ZIP codes more volatile than the first five digits. Factors such as the quantity of postal employees, new construction, and remapping of delivery areas can all contribute to changes in ZIP+4 codes.
 
The USPS provides a free ZIP+4 code lookup tool on their website that can be used to find accurate and up-to-date ZIP+4 codes for specific addresses. By using this tool, individuals and businesses can ensure that their mail is delivered to the correct location in a timely and efficient manner.
 
Using a reliable and accurate ZIP+4 code lookup tool, whether from the USPS or a third-party provider like Firstlogic, can help ensure that your mail is delivered accurately and on time. By reducing the chances of misdeliveries or returned mail, businesses can improve customer satisfaction and reduce costs associated with undeliverable mail.
 
**7 digit postal code if I live in the U.S.?**2019/11/26 14:39 I want to register for a Japanese website so I can get shipped Japanese goods. It is asking for a 7 digit postal code, and wont let me put anything else than that, but I live in the U.S. where my postal code is only 5 digits. What do I do?by Noah (guest)
 
**Re: 7 digit postal code if I live in the U.S.?**2019/11/26 16:46 Did you check if the website is shipping outside Japan?
Since you cannot enter another postal code indicates that the website is only delivering domestic. 
Do you have someone in Japan who can receive and forward the package to you?by justmydayrate this post as useful
 
**Re: 7 digit postal code if I live in the U.S.?**2019/11/26 18:23 Yes, I agree that you should check if they ship outside Japan in the first place.

Often when I (= living in Japan) try to enter my address into a US-based website, from the lack of any dropdown box of �gcountries�h I can tell if they ship to any non-US destinations at all. (They have �gState�h dropdown box, but not the �gcountry.�h) When that happens, I always sends via e-mail with the shop if they ship outside the country, and if yes ask them how I should format my address to fit into their address form. Sometimes they say unfortunately they simply don�ft ship outside the country.
If the postal code really is the only problem, then I would enter your 5 digit plus 00. But then you�fd have to find some place to state �gUSA.�h
