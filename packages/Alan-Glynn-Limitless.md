In both works, there is talk of a "magical" nootropic substance that allows people to use their brain 100%, making them super intelligent, super alert, and focused to the point that basically changes their lives completely.
 
Both works propose brilliant and revolutionary ideas, but they remain just as imaginary in the real world. But, can you imagine a natural substance with capacities similar to those of the famous "NZT-48," popularly known as the "limitless" pill?

The popularization of nootropic or medicinal mushrooms in Western culture presents just this possibility for many people who claim that these mushrooms can increase cognitive abilities to incredible levels and that they could even be nature's "limitless pill."
 
Many users of different ages around the world would say yes. In fact, many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs claim that medicinal mushrooms are nature's original "smart drugs." And in fact, they may be right.
 
Medicinal mushrooms earned a rightful place within integrative medicine as broad-spectrum supplements, the ancient therapeutic legacy they encompass, and the vast body of scientific research that continues to expand around them.
 
Medicinal mushrooms are a natural source of vitamins, minerals, lipids, alkaloids, proteoglycans, polysaccharides, enzymes, and antioxidants. This rich mixture of different nutrients and therapeutic compounds could provide complex beneficial properties for the various biological systems of human beings.
 
Many previous studies and reviews have found that medicinal mushrooms could help modulate the immune system, lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, reduce oxidative stress, fight tumor growth, and even protect against radiation damage.
 
Not really. The famous pill gets its nickname from the namesake movie based on the techno-thriller novel The Dark Fields by Alan Glynn. The name of the limitless pill in the film is NZT-48, and it is not a real pill.

In the movie, the character Edward Morra takes this nootropic drug which, consequently, allows him to use his brain fully and leads to a vast improvement in his lifestyle. However, although the "limitless" pill is not real, functional mushrooms could represent a real alternative for people looking to improve their cognitive abilities.
 
Although the effects of functional mushrooms are not as instantaneous and fancifully powerful as those of the "limitless" pill in the movie, it is a fact that they could boost the mental capacities of some individuals when used in the right way.
 
Several studies suggest that the compounds derived from mushrooms could carry a great capacity to support and regulate the immune system. Despite this, many people still wonder how something that grows out of the ground, mud, and even dirt can carry many potential health benefits.
 
Many people would be surprised to learn that there is even evidence to suggest that numerous compounds found in medicinal mushrooms could potentiate non-specific and specific innate immune responses or acquired immune responses.
 
Among the different immunomodulatory effects derived from functional mushrooms, we found that these active ingredients could induce mitogenicity and activation of immune cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells, resulting in increased production of cytokines.
 
Some researchers believe that some medicinal mushrooms, such as cordyceps sinensis, could promote increased ATP production, more efficient oxygen utilization, and increased tolerance to acidosis in hypoxic conditions and improve the overall quality of life.
 
There is also evidence from these studies to suggest that some medicinal mushrooms may increase antioxidant activity in the red blood cells of older adults to levels commonly observed in young adults.
 
This fungus is highly nutritional, and among its most widely attributed benefits are its possible antioxidant and anti-aging qualities. Additionally, shiitake may be beneficial for heart health, liver health, and immune health.
 
Naturopathic or herbal medicine experts usually recommend reishi to improve immune health, relieve stress and anxiety by helping users feel more balanced, and improve sleep as it can help to reconcile better rest.
 
Reishi stimulates the immune system, which prevents infections. Reishi may also be good for heart health as it is rich in triterpenes and beta-glucans, compounds that can help lower total cholesterol and LDL (bad cholesterol).
 
Science has classified about 14,000 fungi species in nature so far, of which 2,200 are in the "edible mushrooms" category. Among those 2,200 edible mushrooms, about 650 have been scientifically studied, cultivated, or consumed for their possible medicinal qualities or potentially beneficial health.
 
But while there seem to be plenty of mushrooms with potential health benefits for men and women, there is a handful of them that could be potentially beneficial for boosting immune health or promoting general wellness in people.
 
The lion's mane mushroom is one of the most recommended by experts to improve health in different ways, especially cognitive health. Over the years, lion's mane has been shown to be beneficial for immune function and may help treat anxiety and depressive symptoms.
 
There is evidence to suggest that lion's mane may improve mild cognitive impairment and stimulate the production of NGF. This bioprotein plays a vital role in the health, maintenance, and regeneration of neurons in the brain.
 
A low amount of NGF generally links to Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative brain conditions such as dementia. When someone is deficient in NGF and takes any compound that stimulates NGF, they could end up experiencing a headache due to extra neural activity, among other factors.
 
This is why some people wonder if lion's mane causes headaches. But, the truth is that if you have healthy or optimal NGF levels, lion's mane will not cause headaches. On the contrary, it could serve as a treatment for migraine.
 
Another of lion's mane's cognitive-boosting functions is that it may help improve memory, increase creativity, and help with concentration and mental clarity because this functional fungus promotes focus and gives a boost to levels of energy.
 
This is why, although the best time to take lion's mane may vary depending on the purpose and needs of each user, some people use lion's mane as a pre-workout supplement to benefit from the energy boost it gives and thus enhance their performance during your routines.
 
Agaricus may also be beneficial for gut microbiota health, neurogenesis, and natural lovastatin, which is related to cardiovascular health. Its immune-boosting qualities are especially good for improving allergies.
 
Another curious fact about this functional fungus is the low rates of cancer presented by the populations that regularly consumed it in the mountainous regions of the southern Atlantic Forest in So Paulo, Brazil, where this fungus is native.
 
Evidence suggests that turkey tail might be beneficial for people with certain types of cancer. Other studies indicate it might fight leukemia cells and improve the immune system of people receiving chemotherapy.
 
Evidence suggests that cordyceps militaris could be beneficial for patients with respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, kidney conditions, liver conditions, sexual dysfunction, and parasitic and infectious diseases.
