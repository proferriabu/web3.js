As of March 31, Netflix had 270 million subscribers, with a presence in more than 190 countries. And it generated $35 billion in sales in the past 12 months. To be clear, no pure-play streaming service has this kind of reach.
 
By being the first to market, launching its streaming operations in the U.S. in 2007, Netflix was able to rapidly grow its membership base when competition was limited, simply because it had a superior user experience. Over the past few years, we've seen numerous businesses enter the so-called streaming wars. However, it looks like Netflix has already won the battle.
 
Netflix has so many customers and produces so much revenue, a nod to its scale, that it's able to spend massive amounts on content each year ($17 billion target in 2024) but still come out profitable. The business reported a stellar 21% operating margin last year, a figure that has steadily expanded in recent years.
 
Even more impressive, this company is throwing off billions in free cash flow. This is money left over after investing in content acquisition. Management is so confident in Netflix's financial position that the business now has a share buyback program in place.

Netflix's financial prowess puts it in a league of its own in the streaming industry. **Walt Disney**, perhaps its biggest rival, finally reported positive operating income (counting just Disney+ and Hulu). That goes to show you just how far ahead Netflix is, even though competition is certainly fierce.
 
Despite being able to increase revenue and customers 71% and 61%, respectively, between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2024, there is still sizable growth potential for this business. Of course, Netflix will focus on trying to add to its subscriber base, particularly in less developed international markets. Co-CEO Greg Peters estimates the company's total addressable market to be 500 million smart-TV households.
 
Clearly, the stock isn't as cheap as it was around the early summer of 2022, when Netflix was losing subscribers and there were fears that its growth was done. But the situation was characterized by heightened uncertainty at the time, something that isn't the case today.
 
Based on Netflix's trajectory, though, net income is set to soar in the years ahead. And that makes the current valuation seem more palatable. Consequently, I believe investors should still consider buying the stock.
 
In addition to personal endeavours, being unstoppable is even more relevant in business. Regardless if you are in B2B or B2C, the pressure has never been greater to continuously deliver an exceptional customer experience throughout the customer journey, creating an unstoppable business. While there are mountains of available data on the value of CX, here are some compelling insights to consider:
 
All of these customer-centric traits are relevant whether you are evaluating a new software vendor, refrigerator or pair of shoes. So, consider them as you make your next purchase. Remember, the Unstoppables are better than great. They are truly unstoppable because they never stop thinking about you, your needs and their relationship with you.
 
In this blog, we'll explore how Netflix embraced design thinking to transform from a DVD rental service to a global streaming giant. We'll dive into key concepts of design thinking, how Netflix applied them to improve user experiences, and the impact of this approach on their content creation and future plans. Join us on a journey through Netflix's unstoppable evolution, guided by the principles of design thinking.
 
With design thinking, Netflix focused on understanding what people wanted. They studied how users liked to watch and what kind of shows they preferred. This helped Netflix suggest personalized shows and make streaming easy.
 
Instead of waiting for everything to be perfect, Netflix tested new ideas quickly. They added features like autoplay and recommendations based on what users liked. This way, they could make their service better based on feedback.
 
When Netflix faced challenges like getting rights for movies or dealing with different rules in each country, they used design thinking to think creatively. They made original shows and movies that people loved, which set them apart from others.
 
Netflix's success is not just about streaming; it's about strategic problem-solving. When faced with content licensing hurdles, they didn't back down; they created their own blockbuster originals like "Stranger Things" and "The Crown," setting new industry standards.
 
Moreover, Netflix's user interface is a testament to design thinking in action. They prioritize user feedback to enhance usability, making it effortless for millions to navigate and discover new favorites. This commitment to user-centric design fuels customer loyalty and drives growth.
 
Netflix always works to make their website and apps easier to use. They listen to what users say and change things to make it better, like adding profiles and making it easy to find something new to watch.
 
Netflix's success shows how design thinking can help a company grow and change with the times. By focusing on users, trying new things, and staying creative, Netflix has set a good example for others in the digital world.
 
As we celebrate Netflix's journey fueled by design thinking, let's reflect on its broader implications. By adopting this approach, we empower ourselves to redefine what's possible. Let's embrace curiosity, embrace challenges, and embrace the creative spirit that propels us forward.
