Within the Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit exemplify perfect love and justice toward one another (cf. John 8:42; 14:23; 17:23). God is holy and the persons of the Trinity could not treat one another any other way. His holiness is the key to understanding his just dealings with his creation, as well.
 
He will render to each one according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek (Romans 2:6-10).
 
Paul paints a clear picture of the divine justice that rewards everyone according to the decisions they make. However, while God may allow his creatures to sin, he does not do so idly. He warns, corrects, admonishes, and eventually, disciplines.
 
But before I proceed, I need to explain something about my trip to El Salvador. I was not going on a vacation or to visit a resort; it was more of a justice immersion/pilgrimage. My trip was organized by the Ignatian Solidarity Network and CRISPAZ to investigate the lives of the 6 Jesuit martyrs killed 25 years ago as well as current justice issues. The trip was designed to raise consciousness. Though we met beautiful people, we learned about hard issues. We heard first hand testimonies of persons who survived massacres during the civil war. We stood at the site where men of justice were killed and looked at photos of their blood soaked bodies. We heard numerous talks from academics and campesinos about the present reality of the poverty, immigration and violence in El Salvador. As my reflections on justice reveal, I found the trip disturbing, challenging and inspiring.

I learned that the rifle and one million stand for the military aid that the U.S. Government gave to El Salvador. We gave $1 million a day to a military government that massacred more than 34,000 civilians. That same aid, trained and armed the assassins who killed Romero, the six Jesuits and thousands of campesinos. The black section in the middle represents the reign of death and the massacres of the civilian while the X over the dove meant the guns negated peace. I felt directly connected to the images of torture and the martyrdom of the Jesuits through US policy. The oppressors were not just them, the military government of El Salvador; the oppressors were **us**, the United States of America. I felt indicted.
 
So what does it look like to be committed to justice? It looks like commitment. To me, it looks like Ana Zelaya. Commitment is an oath backed by unstoppable love. It is more than a plea (just one letter advocating for change) or an offering (volunteering occasionally or a donation); it is a personal commitment backed by the force of your life.
 
It is a disturbing, challenging and inspiring graduate profile. It is not enough to be committed to justice in word or intention; the goal is doing justice. May we honor it, live into it and love large. **Amen**.
 
Unquestionably believe that which you stated. Your  
favorite reason appeared to be on the net the easiest thing to be  
aware of. I say to you, I definitely get irked while people  
think about worries that they plainly do not know about. You managed to hit the nail upon the  
top as well as defined out the whole thing without having side-effects , people could take  
a signal. Will likely be back to get more. Thanks
 
The Ignatian Solidarity Network (ISN) is a national social justice network inspired by the spirituality of St. Ignatius of Loyola. ISN was founded in 2004 and is a lay-led 501(c)3 organization working in partnership with Jesuit universities, high schools, and parishes, along with many other Catholic institutions and social justice partners.
 
This is not a new thing. Much of my life has been about carrying inside me two streams that both nurture my soul. On one hand has been Rumi, Hafez, medieval Sufism: the extraordinary tradition of Divine love that erupts onto humanity. On the other hand have been movements of social justice committed to redemption and liberation. That bookshelf features Malcolm X, Fanon, Edward Said, more recent works of feminism, Cornel West, and critiques of empire.
 
If we seek a life of the spirit, how do we confront social injustice, poverty, racism, sexism, living under occupation, and violence by both states and non-state entities? What do we have to say? Where do we stand with respect to those who find themselves weak and vulnerable?
 
This linking together of love and justice goes back to the very heart of the best of the American tradition. On April 15, 1960, the student leaders of the sit-in movement at lunch counters met in Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. Under the leadership of Ella Baker, they articulated the statement of purpose for SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. They spoke about nonviolence as their motivating philosophy, and grounded that in love. They stated what they sought:
 
Let us go back to those bold and beautiful revolutionary students from the 1960s, the SNCC folks who turned a reluctant Martin King into an anti-war, anti-colonialism activist. They talked about this love that penetrates justice as the agent of social transformation. Here is what they stated back in 1960, about what happens when love is linked to nonviolence as a method. Then, and only then, we see that:

My Dear Fellow Clergymen:
While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statementcallingmy present activities "unwise and untimely." Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of mywork andideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries wouldhave little timefor anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day, and I would have notime forconstructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that yourcriticisms aresincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patientandreasonable terms.
 
I think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham, since you have been influencedby theview which argues against "outsiders coming in." I have the honor of serving as presidentof theSouthern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every southernstate, withheadquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty five affiliated organizations acrossthe South,and one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Frequently we sharestaff,educational and financial resources with our affiliates. Several months ago the affiliatehere inBirmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct action program if suchweredeemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise.So I,along with several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here. I am herebecause I haveorganizational ties here.
 
But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophetsof theeighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their "thus saith the Lord" far beyondthe boundariesof their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carriedthe gospel ofJesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman world, so am I compelled to carry thegospel offreedom beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedoniancall foraid.
 
Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. Icannot sit idlyby in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere isa threatto justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in asingle garmentof destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can weafford to live withthe narrow, provincial "outside agitator" idea. Anyone who lives inside the United Statescan never beconsidered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.
 
You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I amsorry tosay, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about thedemonstrations. I amsure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of socialanalysis that dealsmerely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate thatdemonstrati
