"Cast is the only platform that fully understands and addresses the problems that all over-the-internet audio shows face. Because of Cast, we can easily produce a high-quality podcast with minimal headaches, which is key to ensuring we can focus our energy on the content rather than on the technical details of the recording process."
 
"What I love most about Cast isn't how easy it is to use, or how much value they offer for the price point - although that's true. Even better is their fantastic customer service and how willing they are to help us and our podcast succeed. I recommend them to EVERYONE, whether they're already podcasting or just getting started."
 
The BINARY operator in expressions differs in effect from the BINARY attribute in character column definitions. For a character column defined with the BINARY attribute, MySQL assigns the table default character set and the binary (\_bin) collation of that character set. Every nonbinary character set has a \_bin collation. For example, if the table default character set is utf8mb4, these two column definitions are equivalent:
 
The use of CHARACTER SET binary in the definition of a CHAR, VARCHAR, or TEXT column causes the column to be treated as the corresponding binary string data type. For example, the following pairs of definitions are equivalent:
 
With CAST(expr AS type syntax, the CAST() function takes an expression of any type and produces a result value of the specified type. This operation may also be expressed as CONVERT(expr, type), which is equivalent. If expr is NULL, CAST() returns NULL.
 
Produces a string with the VARBINARY data type, except that when the expression expr is empty (zero length), the result type is BINARY(0). If the optional length N is given, BINARY(N) causes the cast to use no more than N bytes of the argument. Values shorter than N bytes are padded with 0x00 bytes to a length of N. If the optional length N is not given, MySQL calculates the maximum length from the expression. If the supplied or calculated length is greater than an internal threshold, the result type is BLOB. If the length is still too long, the result type is LONGBLOB.
 
Produces a string with the VARCHAR data type, unless the expression expr is empty (zero length), in which case the result type is CHAR(0). If the optional length N is given, CHAR(N) causes the cast to use no more than N characters of the argument. No padding occurs for values shorter than N characters. If the optional length N is not given, MySQL calculates the maximum length from the expression. If the supplied or calculated length is greater than an internal threshold, the result type is TEXT. If the length is still too long, the result type is LONGTEXT.

Produces a DECIMAL value. If the optional M and D values are given, they specify the maximum number of digits (the precision) and the number of digits following the decimal point (the scale). If D is omitted, 0 is assumed. If M is omitted, 10 is assumed.
 
InnoDB allows the use of an additional ARRAY keyword for creating a multi-valued index on a JSON array as part of CREATE INDEX, CREATE TABLE, and ALTER TABLE statements. ARRAY is not supported except when used to create a multi-valued index in one of these statements, in which case it is required. The column being indexed must be a column of type JSON. With ARRAY, the type following the AS keyword may specify any of the types supported by CAST(), with the exceptions of BINARY, JSON, and YEAR. For syntax information and examples, as well as other relevant information, see Multi-Valued Indexes.
 
CAST() supports retrieval of a TIMESTAMP value as being in UTC, using the AT TIMEZONE operator. The only supported time zone is UTC; this can be specified as either of '+00:00' or 'UTC'. The only return type supported by this syntax is DATETIME, with an optional precision specifier in the range of 0 to 6, inclusive.
 
If you use 'UTC' as the time zone specifier with this form of CAST(), and the server raises an error such as Unknown or incorrect time zone: 'UTC', you may need to install the MySQL time zone tables (see Populating the Time Zone Tables).
 
CONVERT(expr USING transcoding\_name) converts data between different character sets. In MySQL, transcoding names are the same as the corresponding character set names. For example, this statement converts the string 'abc' in the default character set to the corresponding string in the utf8mb4 character set:
 
CONVERT(expr, type) syntax (without USING) takes an expression and a type value specifying a result type, and produces a result value of the specified type. This operation may also be expressed as CAST(expr AS type), which is equivalent. For more information, see the description of CAST().
 
Normally, you cannot compare a BLOB value or other binary string in case-insensitive fashion because binary strings use the binary character set, which has no collation with the concept of lettercase. To perform a case-insensitive comparison, first use the CONVERT() or CAST() function to convert the value to a nonbinary string. Comparisons of the resulting string use its collation. For example, if the conversion result collation is not case-sensitive, a LIKE operation is not case-sensitive. That is true for the following operation because the default utf8mb4 collation (utf8mb4\_0900\_ai\_ci) is not case-sensitive:
 
CONVERT() and CAST() can be used more generally for comparing strings represented in different character sets. For example, a comparison of these strings results in an error because they have different character sets:
 
Character set conversion is also useful preceding lettercase conversion of binary strings. LOWER() and UPPER() are ineffective when applied directly to binary strings because the concept of lettercase does not apply. To perform lettercase conversion of a binary string, first convert it to a nonbinary string using a character set appropriate for the data stored in the string:
 
If the expression to cast is a well-formed geometry of type MultiPoint containing a single Point, the function result is that Point. If the expression contains more than one Point, an ER\_INVALID\_CAST\_TO\_GEOMETRY error occurs.
 
If the expression to cast is a well-formed geometry of type GeometryCollection containing only a single Point, the function result is that Point. If the expression is empty, contains more than one Point, or contains other geometry types, an ER\_INVALID\_CAST\_TO\_GEOMETRY error occurs.
 
If the expression to cast is a well-formed geometry of type Polygon that has no inner rings, the function result is a LineString containing the points of the outer ring in the same order. If the expression has inner rings, an ER\_INVALID\_CAST\_TO\_GEOMETRY error occurs.
 
If the expression to cast is a well-formed geometry of type MultiPoint containing at least two points, the function result is a LineString containing the points of the MultiPoint in the order they appear in the expression. If the expression contains only one Point, an ER\_INVALID\_CAST\_TO\_GEOMETRY error occurs.
 
If the expression to cast is a well-formed geometry of type MultiLineString containing a single LineString, the function result is that LineString. If the expression contains more than one LineString, an ER\_INVALID\_CAST\_TO\_GEOMETRY error occurs.
 
If the expression to cast is a well-formed geometry of type GeometryCollection, containing only a single LineString, the function result is that LineString. If the expression is empty, contains more than one LineString, or contains other geometry types, an ER\_INVALID\_CAST\_TO\_GEOMETRY error occurs.
 
If the expression to cast is a well-formed geometry of type LineString that is a ring (that is, the start and end points are the same), the function result is a Polygon with an outer ring consisting of the points of the LineString in the same order. If the expression is not a ring, an ER\_INVALID\_CAST\_TO\_GEOMETRY error occurs. If the ring is not in the correct order (the exterior ring must be counter-clockwise), an ER\_INVALID\_CAST\_POLYGON\_RING\_DIRECTION error occurs.
 
If the expression to cast is a well-formed geometry of type MultiLineString where all elements are rings, the function result is a Polygon with the first LineString as outer ring and any additional LineString values as inner rings. If any element of the expression is not a ring, an ER\_INVALID\_CAST\_TO\_GEOMETRY error occurs. If any ring is not in the correct order (the exterior ring must be counter-clockwise, interior rings must be clockwise), an ER\_INVALID\_CAST\_POLYGON\_RING\_DIRECTION error occurs.
 
If the expression to cast is a well-formed geometry of type MultiPolygon containing a single Polygon, the function result is that Polygon. If the expression contains more than one Polygon, an ER\_INVALID\_CAST\_TO\_GEOMETRY error occurs.
