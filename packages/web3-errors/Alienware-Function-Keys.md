I am not sure if it works for all models, but on mine if you press Fn+Esc it changes the Fn lock so that F1+F12 work as normal and when you hold Fn+(lets say F11) it will change the brightness or whatever that keys secondary function is. Pressing Fn+Esc again reverts it back to default. Hope this helps.

In most dell laptop (e.g. Studio 1555, Inspiron 1545, Inspiron 3000, Inspiron N5010 etc) the F1-F12 keys at the top of the keyboard are dual function with Multimedia/OEM keys such as volume and screen brightness etc. The problem is, is that the Multimedia/OEM keys are the default, and you have to press the Fn key to get the F1-F12 key to work.
 
For example, this means you have to hit Alt+Fn+F4 to close a window, instead of the regular Alt+F4. This is really annoying. Is there a way to reverse the default functions of the F1-F12 keys in Windows?
 
The media buttons are switched on by default instead of the F keys so to perform a task such as closing a window (Alt-F4), you are required to press Alt-Fn-F4. **To reverse this function, it is necessary to go into the BIOS.**
 
This setting does not appear in the Windows Mobility Center on my system, so I needed to change the setting in BIOS by pressing F2 at boot (no need to press fn F2, even when the keys behave as media keys in Windows). Occasionally, this setting appears to revet and I need to set the option again in the BIOS.
 
Yes, this is possible, but I cannot remember if it is a BIOS setting or software setting. It might just be a combo you push on your keyboard to turn function on or off by default. This can vary from laptop to laptop. On Apple macbook pro's the function is on by default. A dell laptop i had once was off by default and you could change it through a combo on the keyboard.

Alienware has gone back and radically redesigned the chassis of their entire mobile lineup, and it's a difference you can see and feel. Their motif was to capture the difference between the 90s idea of alien technology which informed the previous designs and the modern pop culture idea of alien technology, and amusingly I do think they've found it. The base of the new 17 is bevelled and extends up and out, and illuminated lines ring it.
 
The lid and much of the shell is now aluminum; there's color-configurable illumination of the Alienware logo and two slits in the panel, as well as an aluminum trim surrounding the body of the notebook. Open it up and the interior is still the same soft touch black plastic we're used to from Alienware.
 
Gone is the group of shortcut buttons above the keyboard, with media controls now shifted to Fn key combinations. The keycaps and keyboard layout are also changed; the caps are a bit more subtle and still very comfortable, but the keyboard layout is a step back, I think. The document navigation keys have been moved (but are still dedicated, thankfully), replaced with a row of four configurable keys above the number pad. I feel like the essential problem with this placement is that it's not something you even see on desktop gaming keyboards; the old and more traditional layout was, I think, superior.
 
The new touchpad surface is comfortable and we still have dedicated buttons, but I'm not keen on having the touchpad itself backlit. Alienware went through the trouble of having the backlighting in the keyboard become less obtrusive, so why undermine that decision with a big fat backlit rectangle? It only lights up when you touch it, and it can be disabled entirely (along with all of the configurable lighting as is traditional), but it seems like a waste in the first place. The highlighted touchpad trim on the old chassis was more attractive and more sensible.
 
The interior of the Alienware 17 remains as sensible as ever, though. The battery is no longer easily user-replaceable, but notebooks like this one seldom spend much time off the mains in the first place. We still get a dual fan cooling system that isolates the CPU and GPU from one another. Honestly, this internal design remains relatively easy to service and upgrade independently, but remember that Dell/Alienware has a bad history of generationally updating BIOSes. There's no reason why the M17x R3 can't use a 680M or 780M, for example, or even an Ivy Bridge CPU, but a lack of BIOS updates made all but the 680M impossible, and that chip requires modified drivers.
 
Ultimately I'm fond of the Alienware 17 redesign, especially the switch from a glossy display to matte, but I feel like there's still a void in the market where a sleeker, more sophisticated and frankly adult design could exist. Razer is halfway there, but by being unwilling to produce a thicker machine, they're prevented from using the highest end mobile hardware. This redesign is fine and arguably an upgrade from the old chassis, but there's honestly a lot of room for improvement. Alienware really needs to find the happy medium between form and function.
 
Alienware's AW510K is a full-featured gaming keyboard with CHERRY MX LOW PROFILE switches. In addition to a USB pass-through, dedicated sound control and AlienFX single-key illumination with up to 16.8 million colors, this keyboard offers everything a gamer's heart desires.
 
At first sight this keyboard convinces with its chic design. With the AW510K, Alienware relies on a full-size layout, which is divided into the three areas - the main keys, function keys and numeric keypad - and is thus very clearly arranged. With a height of only 29.4 millimeters, the AW510K has a very flat design and due to the so-called floating keys the lighting effects are very defined and prominent. The frame is made of aluminum, which not only gives the keyboard a very sophisticated look, but also makes it robust and stable. The connection to the PC is made via a two-meter-long braided cable.
 
Although Alienware doesn't provide a palm rest, the fingers rest comfortably on the keys at all times. Because of the flat, staggered arrangement of the floating keys, the gaming keyboard offers high ergonomics to prevent wrist fatigue during long gaming sessions.
 
In order to be able to make quick and trouble-free audio adjustments, the keyboard offers a dedicated audio control with a practical volume roller. A built-in mute button can be used to mute the sound completely.
 
Of course, the keyboard also features N-key rollover and anti-ghosting, ensuring that even complex key combinations or simultaneous keys presses are accurately detected. For charging external devices or directly connecting a headset, Alienware also integrates a USB pass-through port.
 
Full RGB lighting with up to 16.8 million colors is just as much a part of a premium gaming keyboard as CHERRY MX switches. The Alienware AW510K has both. The in-house AlienFX technology offers the possibility to configure lighting effects that react directly to the game. This creates a particularly immersive gaming experience. AlienFX is currently supported by more than 200 games, such as Warhammer Vermintide 2, Kingdom Come: Deliverance or League of Legends. The Alienware Command Center also allows for full key programming and macro creation. Settings are saved directly to the keyboard's built-in memory.
 
Besides its elegant look, the customizable single-key illumination and the intuitive AlienFX software are certainly the highlights of the AW510K. Alienware also knows how to impress us with practical features, such as dedicated audio controls and a useful USB pass-through port. With its pleasantly flat design and the slightly raised chassis at the back, the keyboard offers a very high level of comfort and doesn't put excessive strain on the wrists, even during prolonged use. However, its greatest strength are the CHERRY MX LOW PROFILE RGB RED switches, which give ambitious gamers a real advantage with high switching frequencies and very fast triggering process.
 
Alienware, known for gaming PCs, expanded into peripherals like cameras, headphones, and keyboards. At CES, they unveiled the Pro KB, a unique gaming keyboard with solid RGB keys. Unlike traditional keyboards, it prioritizes gaming with a compact design and omits the numeric keypad and function keys. Constructed with durable materials, it was designed with feedback from pro gamers and features a 1 kHz polling rate with wireless and wired connectivity options. Users can store up to five profiles onboard. However, its unique design may require adjustments, as users may accidentally press keys due to the lack of a palm rest. While most gamers may prefer wired connections for maximum speed, the keyboard offers impressive battery life when used wirelessly.
 
**What do we think?**Rock-solid keyboard with big positive RGB keys and three connection options, plus storage for up to five profiles. Taller than most keyboards, and heavier, it is compact and would easily fit in a backpack.
 
Keyboards evolved to thin, short-stroke, silent keys in a thin case for most IT users, and for the gamers and other purists, the larger mechanical key type. Kind of like audiophiles who prefer vacuum tubes to solid-state amplifiers. And like the audiophiles, the gamers paid more for their preference.
 
In addition to making the best gaming PC, Alienware also turned its attention to peripherals like cameras, headphones, mice, and keyboards. In January at CES, Alienware showed its new Pro KB, unlike any keyboard you have seen or felt before.
 
The keyboard is sampled at a 1 kHz polling rate via a 2.4 GHz wireless and USB-C wired connections. And with onboard profiles and optional Bluetooth connectivity, users can take their personalized settings with them. You can store up to five profiles in the keyboard.
