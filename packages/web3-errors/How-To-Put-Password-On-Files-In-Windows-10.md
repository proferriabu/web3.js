Create a strong password, ideally one that you can easily remember. But in case you might forget, you should also keep a copy of it in a safe place.

If you lose or forget your document password, Word won't be able to recover it for you. It may be possible for your IT admins to help with password recovery, but only if they had implemented the DocRecrypt tool before you created the document password. 

 
Word Online cannot password encrypt a document. Also, it cannot edit a password-encrypted document. To password protect a Word document, use Open in Word to open it in the desktop version of Word. Thereafter, you must use the Word desktop program to open and edit the document.
 
If you're concerned about people in your organization losing access to password-protected Microsoft 365 files, consider implementing the DocRecrypt tool. Note that DocRecrypt can only help to recover files that were encrypted after it was implemented. For more information see Remove or reset file passwords using DocRecrypt.

If your laptop is stolen, the thief can boot up your computer from a removable device and access your files. Or, they can remove the hard disk, install it on another computer, and gain access to all of your files and personal data.
 
Keep your data safe with Avast BreachGuard. If your passwords or other personal data are ever leaked online, BreachGuard will warn you ASAP. That way, you can regain control of your accounts before anyone has the chance to log in with your credentials.
 
Folder Lock comes with a powerful file shredder and a cloud-based backup solution as well. The demo is free, while the full-version is $39.95. Knowing how to lock a folder in Windows costs a bit of money, but the functionality and customization makes it worth it. Now you know how to password protect a folder.
 
You can also use disk-encryption software for more robust security than just a password. These tools block even the most advanced brute-force attacks, which try to crack passwords and encryption keys using different combinations.
 
This kind of full-encryption software adds an extra layer of security by incorporating both **password**and **encryption**protection to your files, meaning that the actual contents of files and folders are encrypted and protected by much stronger and more complex decryption keys.
 
With support for AES, Serpent, and TwoFish keys, VeraCrypt is a free, cross-platform data security tool that can encrypt files very effectively. VeraCrypt comes with full disk encryption but can encrypt at the volume (folder) level as well. Users can decide whether they want specific folders encrypted or entire systems.
 
**Password protection** is like locking something in a safe, like a highly sensitive document. **Encryption** is like rearranging all the letters in a document so that they can only be placed back in the correct order if you have a special decoder key.
 
You should password protect files because if you share your computer with others, someone might accidentally delete or modify an important file, or even share a private folder. You might even make the critical error yourself, accidentally sending sensitive information to the wrong person.
 
Sharing a computer is not a problem if you add a password to your most sensitive files. Entering a password every time you access that file may slow you down a bit, but the added security is worth it.
 
And you can always use Windows to **encrypt an entire folder**, as described above. Knowing how to password protect a folder and how to encrypt your files is key to making sure your content is locked up tight.
 
Consider what might happen if you lost your master password, if your encryption software got corrupted, or if the files themselves got lost. Backing up your data regularly and using a password manager can help ensure that never happens. You can even clone your entire hard drive to an external storage device.

Windows logon passwords are never stored in their original form and always encrypted. They are stored in C:/WINDOWS/SYSTEM32/config (Assuming windows installed in C drive) folder. Passwords are stored in files called sam files. But they are hashed and so encrypted.
 
Windows is the most common desktop platform currently in use. As a result, it is not uncommon for hackers to encounter a Windows password that they need to crack in order to gain access to a specific account on a machine or move laterally throughout the network.
 
With NTLM, cracking Windows passwords is more difficult but still possible. NTLM is weaker than modern algorithms because it is based on the MD4 cipher. While it has been replaced by Kerberos for network authentication, NTLM is still used for saving passwords locally in the Windows SAM file.
 
Since the Windows hash function is based on the weak MD4 algorithm, cracking these passwords is often easier than those protected by an equivalent modern cipher. Cracking a Windows password hash is a three-step process:
 
The most common is taking them directly from the machine in question. Windows password hashes are stored in the SAM file; however, they are encrypted with the system boot key, which is stored in the SYSTEM file. If a hacker can access both of these files (stored in C:WindowsSystem32Config), then the SYSTEM file can be used to decrypt the password hashes stored in the SAM file. The SAM file is not directly accessible on a running Windows system, but it can be accessed via tools like Mimikatz or through the **reg** command (if the hacker has SYSTEM privileges).
 
Password hashes can also be stolen by taking advantage of authentication to a remote server. A hacker who sends a user a link pointing to a file on a hacker-controlled server can trick the target computer into trying to authenticate with the current login credentials. This allows a hacker to steal a password hash with a well-crafted phishing email.
 
Both of these techniques have their pros and cons. Stealing the Windows SAM file requires access to the target computer but can steal more password hashes in one go. A phishing attack allows an attacker to steal a hash remotely but may require an unpatched computer and access to certain ports through any firewalls that lie in the way.
 
Most people use extremely weak passwords. The average person probably uses a dictionary word with common substitutions (0 for O, 4 for A and so on) and potentially a special character and a couple of numbers tacked onto the end. A password cracking tool with a standard English dictionary can crack these passwords without any difficulty.
 
While this may have been secure in the past, it can now be defeated by a hacker with access to the right hardware and software. In February 2019, the team building hashcat stated that the tool can be used to search the entire space of eight-character passwords in about 2.5 hours. Since most users will choose the minimum length when creating a password (especially when capitals, lowercase, numbers and special characters may be required by configuration), this means that these passwords can be cracked in a few hours.
 
Dictionary and brute-force attacks make tradeoffs between speed and guarantee of success. Most tools also support a hybrid attack mode which performs a dictionary attack first and then switches to a brute-force attack if unsuccessful. A lot of subject-matter expertise and optimization goes into these tools, making them extremely effective at password cracking.

Using password protection to lock files and folders increases your digital privacy and security, because it means you need to enter a password to open your documents. When you password lock your files, no one can access them without knowing the password, which helps protect your personal information and data.
 
Password protection means that only those who know the password can access the information. Encryption is a more secure form of protection, because data is scrambled using an encryption algorithm and can only be unscrambled and accessed with a decryption key.
 
Unlike password protection, encryption scrambles the contents of individual files so that the data is unreadable. Encryption is like randomly shuffling all the letters of a document and making it so that only someone with a decryption key can unscramble the data and read the document.
 
But encryption and password protection are only as strong as the passwords used to secure their contents. So, whichever method you choose, be sure to create unique, hard-to-crack passwords and use two factor authentication.
 
VeraCrypt is a versatile folder locking tool that can store data securely in a number of formats and across multiple platforms. As well as individual folders and files, this free software can password lock an en
