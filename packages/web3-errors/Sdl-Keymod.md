I do not have any info about any key mod sights, but with the limited experience that i have had with keymod I would suggest a barrel mounted front sight for sure. I have seen a fairly smart guy not able to keep his bipod affixed with the magic keymod. Whenever it falls off the response is "keymod YO".
 
We remove the rails to make the handguard lighter and flimsier, then we bolt the rails back on so we have a place to hang our crap that is less rigid and more prone to vibrating loose. Either that or the manufacturers found a way to make us buy 8 pieces for $350 instead of 2 for $150. Any precision sighting device has no business being attached to any of the current crop of long, floppy modular hand guards, regardless of attachment system. In my opinion anyhow. I put a front sight on a 15" keymod (won't say whose) and got more than 3moa of impact shift just by shooting off a bipod. You could see the deflection between barrel and guard just by resting the rifle's weight on it. Attach the sight to the part of the gun the bullet comes out of.

I'm looking to run these for those super close targets that end up getting shot on the run...I mean close like the dirty bird targets you see at 15 feet. Gonna mess around this weekend with just pointing and see how that goes. Them I'm gonna run it with my scope down on 1 power to see how that feels. I don't think 3 MOA of float will matter at 15 feet...so that doesn't bother me, but thanks for the heads up though. It's something ill keep in mind when deciding on this.
 
Really close targets why would you even need sights. yesterday instead of clearing the last round on the public range i took a off hand shot on a 200yard piece of steel(lucky) and i might not be able to do it again but the length of the handguard's top rail is good enough reference for me. and if you take the time to roll you gun over you are probably wasting time just getting you head inline to take a shot.
 
Don't really care which is cool or not.....just faster. Like I said gonna play around this weekend and see what it's like to hammer on close targets with the scope at one power and then just pointing. If I can still get good hits by pointing then I see no reason to put any sights on the rifle. Just experimenting though. The clock won't lie
 
Offsets aren't for a quick blast at a huge close target. They are for the half a target obscured by a no-shoot and a wall. Or the head-shot over a no-shoot. If your rifle stock fits properly, rolling the gun should not add ANY time. If it does, you are transitioning somewhere you shouldn't. Running offset sights with practice will be hands-down faster than trying to center the top of a rib in front of a target, especially if there is a scope in the way. When you play around, add some partially blocked targets and see how much it slows down your point-shooting. You might be surprised.
 
This works great on 3 of my rifles, expensive as most of the 419 products are, but this one of the few companies making quality products of this nature and continue to try to improve design to make things more functional. I wish they made this in a few more longer options. I like the placement of the locking blocks and screws as this allowed these rails to work across the quick detach holes and other spots in the 3 different manufacturers handgaurds, every other across rail I bought offline was shorter than these and had fit issues near the non keymod holes, these worked great.
