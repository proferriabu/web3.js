This is also the final traditionally animated film to be animated before the 2D area shut down in the studio (Home on the Range finished production before Brother Bear, and the latter was supposed to be released in April of 2004, but they swapped dates, pushing Brother Bear to November 2003).
 
So the film starts with an elderly Denahi (Jason Raize) telling his tribe the story of him and his brothers Stika (D. B. Sweeney) and Kenai (Joaquin Phoenix) when they were 3 young men (or teens), and he establishes that the youngest Kenai wanted to so bad be a man. We immediately get some insight on their world, their culture, and how they believe, which they did not do so well in Pocahontas.
 
So we first see Kenai being chased by a bunch of Moose (who he probably harassed), and which causes him to argue with his youngest younger brother Denahi, with Stika being the middle man. We then learn that today is Kenai`s ceremony of becoming a man, where he will be given a totem which will represent what will make him a man. Before they do that, they have to go fishing, and we get a song sung by Tina Turner (though I do not know what she has anything to do with this) called Great Spirits. It shows the three brothers having fun as they catch fish, and their interactions are very genuine but also too 2003, if you know what I mean.
 
So when he gets to his totem ceremony, he gets the totem of a bear from the shaman Tanana (Josn Copeland), as he represents Love, which he does not like. Denahi teases him about it, and Kenai gets overly angry at this, and he almost fights with Denahi, before Stika separates it. Apparently bears have no feelings, emotions, don`t know what love is, and love has nothing to do with being a man; according to Kenai. Denahi is told to check the fish, which they come to realize that Kenai left the basket on the floor, and the fish is gone. So after the brothers continue to exchange in modern 2003 slang and talk, Kenai goes to get more fish.

So instead of taking responsibility for the screw up that he KNOWS about, he goes and throws a rock at the bear, which causes it to lash out at him. Because it is the bear`s fault that you willingly left the basket on the floor and screw up. SO is brothers save him, and this ends up in a fight.
 
So after they have a funeral for him, Kenai tells his brother that they are going after the bear to kill it, but Denahi refuses, as he feels like Kenai is to blame for Sitka`s death and not the beat. Kenai still thinks the entire thing is the bear`s fault. I think Stika`s death is the fault of Stika (he cracked the ice, knowing he would die) and Kenai (he LEFT the basket knowingly, blamed the bear for him getting caught, provoked the bear, and causing his brothers to follow him to clean up his mess). Kenai goes after it, and kills the bear couldn`t Kenai be the one that got killed, or at least beat the fuck out of?
 
Now the spirits and most of the viewing audience is mad and annoyed with Kenai, so he is suddenly turns into a bear by the spirits, so he can learn his lesson. Denahi climbs up the cliff to see the bear (Kenai; the bear looks NOTHING like Kenai) before it falls into the river.
 
So Kenai the bear runs into Tanana who tells him that in order to be a man and to become human again, and she tells him that the spirit of Sitka (I have been calling him Stika the entire time; shows how forgettable this movie can be at times) did this to him, and that he needs to go to the Northern Lights on a mountain to make a plea bargain with him for the crime he did, but Kenai refuses to see that he did nothing wrong.
 
He struggles with being a bear, and bumps into the brother mooses our failed, stereotypically Canadian comic relief Rutt and Tuke (Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas), and soon bumps into a cub named Koda (Jeremy Suarez), after he is stuck in a rope. He gets out, only to find a vengeful Denahi ready to kill him, though he thinks Denahi is there to kill him. He runs into a crack of ice, where Koda follows him. Koda and Kenai somehow make a deal to go to the Northern Lights with one another, so Kenai can become a human again, and so Koda (who is so fucking annoying, almost as annoying as Kenai`s voice) can reunite with his missing mother.
 
We get a song sung by Phil Collins (who again did a lot of the soundtrack) called I`m On My Way, and it is a decent song, here we supposedly see Kenai and Koda grow closer, as they cover a lot of distance to get to the Northern Lights. The moose follow them. Kenai talks about Sitka to Koda to give us some failed character redemption and Koda thanks Sitka for letting him and Kenai meet. These two then annoy me with a bunch of useless talking, and their annoying personalities and voices. as they eventually leave the moose.
 
So Denahi becomes a human, and the first thing he does is to go to Koda. He chooses to become a bear instead of living his life as a human with his ACTUAL brother #SlapInTheFace. Denahi and Koda are in the same predicament; both have no family, are relatively young, and would have to live with a tribe of non family members, but you CHOSE TO LIVE WITH A BEAR YOU HAVE KNOWN FOR A FEW DAYS OVER A BROTHER YOU HAVE KNOWN FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS? Apparently it makes him a man and everyone is happy about it because the plot requires it to, but would NEVER happen in reality. He gets his paw on the wall on his tribe at the end of the film
 
I have to say that the animation is pretty good. It is nothing special, but the traditional animation looks really good in this film, and the CGI is not as noticeable, and actually aged well. The colors are very vibrant and eye drawing. I like how the native characters do not have fully caucasian features with just the darker skin on the characters.
 
When it came to reviews, it received mixed reviews. While some said that it had a more serious theme than its predecessors and had some heart, others criticized it for its thin and unengaging story and characters.
 
Well, it has been almost 11 years since it has been released, and today, not many people remember it. And the people that do remember it does not really have the nicest things to say about it. They either say it is mediocre at best, or horrible at worst. It is not THE worst film in the canon, but ti is definitely near the bottom. Disney NEVER talks about this film.
 
The modern talk is honestly the least of my issues with this film. I do see how this film has potential, but potential does not mean anything if it is carried through improperly, or in an unlikable way that the writers did not intend it to be.
 
Kenai just crossed the line from being just a jerk. He is an insufferable, ungrateful, reckless POS, and I do find it ridiculous that this bear means so much more to him than his brother. He was unlikable from beginning to end to me. The film is pretty much acting like he never knew what love was like before he met the little bear.
 
I watch Nostalgia Critic, and watched his review for this film, but I honestly found the ending to be just as ridiculous as the middle tbh. They should have put in the song after the confession scene, which was better than what made it in the final cut.
 
I think that is the issue with a lot of films, with them thinking that we are as oblivious as the characters in the movie, so we would end up being surprised when a twist comes around. I know what you mean with it feeling like filler.
 
You were a lot kinder to this film than I was. It drove me crazy because I felt like every choice they made was off. The animation of the bears was off-putting, voices, songs, dialogue, song placement, unlikable lead character, pacing, unbelievable ending. It was so frustrating for me because I saw the potential unlike something like Chicken Little that just sucks. This was so close to being good and they kept making the wrong choices. I mean Tina Turner for your Inuit Bear movie? All the strange choices made me mad.
 
I guess I was a bit nicer, but I was still pretty harsh on this film. They definitely kept on making the wrong decisions for this movie, which sucks because it ripped away the small potential the film had. The voice acting was not good in this film, definitely. This film was jut really watered down, and ridiculous with what it is trying to get us to believe.

His use of Photoshop in his videos is so easy to view and follow. I take screen shots as I follow along in whichever course I am watching so that I can go back and re-draw my sketch over and over from his reference material. I have found that the more times I do a sketch over, I get better, quicker, and more able to spot mistakes in pr
