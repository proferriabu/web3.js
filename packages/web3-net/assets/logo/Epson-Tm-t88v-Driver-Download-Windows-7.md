I found another reference that appears to be more complete. It seems the APG (Application Program Guide) is no longer being published as of v10.05 (which is the one I have), and it does not appear to contain references to the 88V (it mentions 88IV however).

Tried digging around the Epson drivers themselves, and found that the Advance Printer Driver 5 displays the feature more prominently in the second tab, whilst in APD version 4, the buzzer is hidden under some settings. In both versions of the driver you can get them to work though, through a regular windows print job, however not from POS.
 
Also tried to add the printer as a windows printer using the advanced printer driver 4 which installs and creates an LPT1 port, but although listed in printers and faxes within windows, the error says no connection. I also tried to add the printer as a serial port COM1 but the same problem within Windows.

If you are using a serial interface to the printer that may be causing some of the delay. It seems to me that the receipt should print as fast as the Z report, so I would make one last look through the receipt properties and make sure that all fonts are set to Epson built-in fonts (maybe I missed one), the thinking here being that the receipt may be using a font that the Z report is not, thus slowing the receipt.
 
Z Report is like machine gun fire. standard receipts are slow off the mark, but then quite quick. Much improved!! I would say that the till receipts take about 10 seconds to print. They are much happier.
 
Marc, Youre and absolute genius!! Printer and cash drawer working, but the printing speed is REALLY slow. Is there any way of speeding up the printer, as the cash drawer opens immediately after transaction....but then you have to wait 1 minute for the receipt to print.
 
The Epson TM 88 Bon printer stops time and again when the receipt or receipt is printed. The Epson also jerky and sometimes the bon goes out but often not.   
I first thought it is because of the printer and have exchanged the model TM81, but without Result, anyone an idea what that can be? I use the softare 3.70.  
this is my 2nd question, i can easily update this version to a higher like 4.x, so that all data and attitudes are taken over? Thank you for help.
 
I've already tried that, uninstalled the epson driver and then discontinued as you recommended. But then some nonsense was printed and the cash drawer did not open. I need a detailed guide, which driver do I have to install, which attitude, thank you very much.
 
can it also be the version of unicenta? Regardless, can I install a higher version over the older one, and all settings and product entries are preserved? how should I proceed, which version do you recommend?
 
I do have pretty like the same problem but my printer is USB  
Ok uninstall windows driver and use OPOS  
OK select Epson > ok select file > which port should I select for USB printer?  
Thanx in advance
 
I need to setup a RasPi for some hardware things in a p.o.s. environment, like scanners, scale and printers (3 printers).So I took a brand new RasPi, did a complete new installation with apache2, cups and the epsonsimplecups driver, found here on youtube and here on Github and connected a thermo printer Epson TM-T88IV.Everything went without any errors, including setup CUPS for external access.Now I can print local files and over network, so good so far.
 
First make sure that no printer drivers listed under Control Panel | Printers that have their port set to the same port as your receipt printer (ex. COM1: USB001, etc.,).
 
 1. Download the recommended Epson OPOS drivers attached to this article, or visit www.epsonexpert.com for the latest version. (2.30E is our recommended driver for XP. 2.64E is our recommended driver for Windows 7 Pro.)
 
 Unzip and run setup.exe from Disk 1.
 
 2. During the installation, you can click next through each window except when it asks for Epson CO or Common Control Object. MAKE SURE TO CHOOSE Common Control Objectif prompted.
 
 3. Once installed, go to Start | Programs | OPOS | Setup.
 
 4. Right click on POSPrinter and add new device.
 
 5. Select TM-T88III (works for all Epson printer models) or TM-T88IV if you have that model.
 
 6. Select the model number ending in P if using a parallel model, such as TM-T88IIP, U for USB. Click next. This will register the name of the printer as shown oryuu shouldassign an LDN name to the device, such as "Receipt" or "receipt\_printer1". Click Next.
 
 Note: The printer name must match the name of the OPOS device as defined under Manager | Databases Registers | Register X | Receipt Printer 1 tab.
 
 7. If serial, the printer will defaul to COM1. If parallel select the LPT port that this printer is connected to.
 
 Note: If USB, select the U option and make sure the printer is listed in Hardware Devices as a USB device and not as a unknown printer device.
 
 8. Click the Check Health Interactive button. You should receive a test receipt if the printer drivers are configured correctly. This must pass successfully before it will work in Store Operations. Click Finish to complete the OPOS installation for the printer
 
 Note: If you receive an error, make sure no other printer driver is assigned to the port you want to use.
 
 If you have a cash drawer connected to the Epson Printer, follow the steps below to setup the drawer:
 
 9. Right click where it says CashDrawer & choose add new device.
 
 10. Select default or Standard as the model (if default does not work). You should next assign an LDN name to the device, such as "Drawer" or "cash\_drawer1". Click next.
 
 Note: The drawer name must match the name of the OPOS device as defined under Manager | Databases Registers | Register X | Drawer X.
 
 11. Select StandardP as the detailed model if Parallel or U for USB. Click Next.
 
 12. Select the same port that the cash drawer is on. (This should be the same port as you selected for step 7.) If serial, the COM port should already be selected for you.
 
 13. Click on Check Health Interactive for the cash drawer & the drawer should pop open.
 
 14. Go into Store Operations Manager and open the register properties (Database | Registers | Register List). Enter "Receipt" for the OPOe LDNS device name in Receipt Printer 1 if you defined this as LDN in Step 6. Enter "Drawer" as the OPOS device name for the cash drawer if you defined this as the LDN. Make sure you have a receipt format selected for the Receipt Printer.
 
 15. Test the printer & the cash drawer by performing a sales transaction in POS.
 
 If you receive any errors configuring the driver, Epson provides phone support for Point Of Sale products from 7am-5pm, M-F, PST. Call (562) 276-1314 and select option 1 (Installation and Configuration). You can also contact DRS Support for online assistance and setup.
 
 If you have problems running the latest OPOS driver with your hardware we suggest trying an older OPOS driver. See attachments below.
 
 If your parallel port is not recognized, try changing the BIOS setting for that port to ECP, EPP or bi-directional, until the port is recognized by the OPOS driver.
 
TIP: Set the CPL (characters per line) to 42 from 44 under Receipt Format, Properties, Properties and Epson printers will print using a larger font size (without using more paper). This needs to be set in two places on the form.
