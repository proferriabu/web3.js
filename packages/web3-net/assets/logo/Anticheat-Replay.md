The staff can then just visit a replay, enter in the time code, and see everything from an untampered, unbiased view. There would be no way for anyone to get away with pretty much anything. ReplayMod would be the ultimate anti-cheat.

ReplayMod as is would obviously is not suitable for this, what I'm proposing is a server-side plugin that uses whatever magic ReplayMod does to create a replayable file of everything that happens in each server. This is only accessible to staff, so there won't be any issues with players being able to get where they shouldn't in /spec. 

The limitations I see are:

Replay Files are pretty small, but I'd still assume that servers would only really be able to keep a full backup of maybe, a week.

Based on what I've seen from ReplayMod, to view any point in MC, the mod must playback everything from start till that point, meaning replay files will need to be broken up by, say, hour. The question is, would a server restart need to take place for that? For minigames, that's fine, but games like factions would only be able to handle at most a couple scheduled restarts.

Current ReplayMod records what a player sees, I'm unsure if it would work the same way when recording EVERYTHING that is going on in a server. If this just blows resource consumption up way too much, perhaps have the option to only record player movement data (Client side recorder?).

I know there are a lot of limitations that MC just won't let you get around, so the question is, do these limitations make my suggestion not feasable?

The ability to still make cinematics from these recordings would be a great boost to server media staff toolbox too, so no need to ditch that if possible.
 
Huh, so what it looks like is that ReplayMod works is really the only way to do what ReplayMod does? There isn't really any getting around those inconveniences? 

Just gonna throw out another suggestion: What if it was part of a client-side anticheat, where all players basically run RM the same way it already works, but the replays are either streamed to a central cloud, or simply stored locally and uploaded when server staff request it. Optionally, the file format would be only viewable to MC accounts registered as staff to \_\_\_ server, this could be where you charge, and would fix the issue of replays not being allowed in games where it's "xray" is an issue. Users deleting their replays before a set time period, say, a week, can be considered a bannable offense. Replays would be automatically deleted upon the expiration date of, say a week, unless the player is flagged.

On the efficiency side of things, you could make these replays only store certain data pertaining to the one player, to avoid redundancy, but yea that would make some things more complicated.

If the case for this just is that this would be hard, provided that it is close enough to the described function I described, remember that you could sell this for lots of money. If it meant eliminating cheaters, you crush the competition in this business . I don't know if that would make the effort required worth it.

Side note, if I understand ReplayMod, in theory, couldn't you allow separate replay files whenever are reloading a world from scratch? This would be whenever you move to a new server (ie between lobbies), or when you enter a new dimension. I noticed that a replay with lots of these reloads will take a lot longer to edit, because it has to go through each reload that occurs before the cursor. This could be an optional setting, but it would allow much faster access times, as working with hour-long replays is a PAIN when I have to wait 30 seconds every time I move the cursor back.

Earlier this year we announced a replay investigation tool that captured gameplay data so it could be converted into video internally, allowing our teams to review player matches for problem behavior. This tool has been beneficial since it launched, but the team wanted to drive toward a new goal: Speed.
 
Cheaters are always looking for easy ways to get into the game, and stealing accounts is one of the ways they do this. Securing your account by enabling 2FA is important, as is making sure you are not reusing passwords for your Activision ID that you would for other apps or websites. Reusing passwords on other apps or websites in connection with your email can open the door to your account being stolen.
 
In 2023, our teams were able to identify over 110,000 player accounts on the dark web that were parsed from reused email and password combinations. We have since reset these accounts, returning them to their original owners to prevent these accounts from falling into the wrong hands.
 
Another important piece of this prevention puzzle is our game code obfuscation and encryption. To play Call of Duty, we send each player the game code (via the game executable) to experience the game. When we send out the game executable, which contains detailed instructions for how our game works, we are essentially sending out copies of our house keys. Imagine trying to keep a bad guy who has copies of your keys from breaking into your home.
 
To make it harder to unlock the front door, the RICOCHET Anti-Cheat teams are constantly working on new obfuscation techniques to make the game code harder for bad actors to analyze. We then encrypt (or digitally lock) the entire Call of Duty executable, so it is much harder to tamper with. This makes it more difficult for the cheat developers to analyze and modify our code and remove our protections.
 
When we take steps to stop cheaters, they readjust their process and look for new opportunities. The nature of multiplayer games, where our systems (the server) exchanges information with your computer (the clients) to make the multiplayer action happen, is how cheating can occur. Our anti-cheat efforts tackle each touchpoint of this trust process, from client to server-side systems and enhancing those process with Machine Learning to combat unfair play.

A common misconception we see is that spam reporting will result in actions being taken against accounts. For clarity, whether one player reports another once or multiple times, our system only considers the first report (throttling any additional reports from that player).
 
Reporting is critical but, must be used in combination with other factors before an account is actioned on. An account, for example, cannot be banned due only to reporting but if that account has also triggered other (and multiple) detections, a report can raise a red flag.

Now when someone gets an outrageous high score, you can check how exactly they achieved that. This does not just allows you to catch cheaters, it also gives you great data to find out how the players are playing the game, which you can use to improve it. And if you also allow your players to view the replays of the top scorers, then they can learn from that.
 
It's still not 100% bullet-proof though, because someone could still use a program to generate a fake replay showing a perfect playthrough. But that requires a lot more effort than just sending an INT\_MAX value to your API endpoint, because the cheater first needs to figure out how a perfect playthrough actually looks like.
 
Even installing anti-cheat software on the client won't prevent them from sending false data over the internet.For more details on the topic, you can look at a similar question on the Information Security Stack Exchange.
 
Sad news flash for you friend. Half the people on this forum refuse to accept that this game has cheaters. 100% of us know it wont matter anyway. 1/3 of them complain about being banned for various reasons more than likely cheating. This game is toast and it doesnt matter how many replay codes we throw up there the issue will never be addressed bc all you have to do is make a free email account to continue killing this game.

Most people who argue against kernel-based anticheat are simply people who are afraid that they will no longer be able to cheat in this game. Privacy and security concerns are just an excuse and can easily be invalidated.
 
you can show anyone a cheater in a game, its blatantly obvious they cheat, and they will do everything that they can to enter a state of denial because its comforting to them to think that nothing is wrong, when it clearly is.
 
If the anti-cheat system was disabled by default, it would be much easier for cheaters to find a workaround and disable this protection when it is enabled. Because Tacview assumes that the session should be protected by default, if a cheater was trying to circumvent the system, in the worst case, he/she would still be stuck with the default 10 minutes delay. Better to be safe than sorry...
 
It seems that 10 minutes is a good average which should work well with most servers (for both slow and fast movers). Reme
