Directed by Seth Kearsley, the movie has a Jewish alcoholic troublemaker, Davey Stone, at the helm. He is constantly in trouble with the law for his wild ways and gets arrested after creating another nuisance by refusing to pay for his food, attempting to evade the authorities, and destroying public decorations in the process. He is sent to do community service in the form of referee-in-training for a Youth Basketball League and a comical disaster ensues.

An ardent fan of all thriller movies, classic and contemporary, Sounak chose the keyboard over the proverbial pen to express himself. A master's degree in Literature and a library full of books helped him a lot in doing so. Before ComingSoon, he clattered away on his keyboard, toiling for edutech and fintech companies. Crime documentaries keep him up at night (in a good way), and he has watched enough to plot the perfect crime. Not only does he research the cases he writes about, but he also loves to talk about them in detail with his friends.
