**OHSAS 18001**, Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, was an international standard for occupational health and safety management systems that was subsequently adopted as a British Standard. Compliance with it enabled organizations to demonstrate that they had a system in place for occupational health and safety. BSI cancelled OHSAS 18001 to adopt ISO 45001. ISO 45001 was published in March 2018 by the International Organization for Standardization.[1] Organizations that are certified to OHSAS 18001 were able to migrate to ISO 45001 by March 2021 to retain a recognized certification.[2]
 
Organizations worldwide recognize the need to control and improve health and safety performance and do so with occupational health and safety management systems (OHSMS). However, before 1999 there was an increase of national standards and proprietary certification schemes to choose from. This caused confusion and fragmentation in the market and undermined the credibility of individual schemes.

OHSAS 18000 family was developed by the OHSAS project Group, The British Standards Institution (BSI) currently provides the Secretariat of the OHSAS Project Group. The standard is based upon the Plan-Do-Check-Act system common to ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.
 
OHSAS 18000 assists organizations in managing and controlling their health and safety risks. IT is an internationally accepted occupational health and safety management system that can be assessed by a third party (Registrar).

ISO 45001 is designed to replace OHSAS 18001 next year; in fact, organizations who are already certified to OHSAS 18001 will need to migrate to ISO 45001 by the end of March 2021. Businesses who do not transition over to an ISO 45001 certification will find themselves without an accredited occupational health and safety management system and will lose the benefits that come with that title.
 
ISO 45001 is the new ISO standard for occupational health and safety. It is set to drastically improve levels of workplace safety and productivity. With an emphasis on management commitment, worker involvement, and risk control, ISO 45001 aims to prevent work-related injuries, illnesses, and fatalities by specifying requirements for an occupational health and safety management system.
 
This new standard, which will replace OHSAS 18001, follows the approach of other management systems such as ISO 14001 and ISO 90001. While ISO 45001 draws on certain aspects of OHSAS 18001, it is a new and distinct standard, not a revision or update, and is due to be phased out to organizations gradually over the next three years. Businesses will need to ensure their current thinking and worksite safety practices are in order to maintain organizational compliance.
 
OHSAS 18001 focuses on controlling hazards. It provides a framework for the effective management of occupational health and safety including all aspects of risk management and legal compliance. It addresses occupational health and safety rather than any specific product safety matters.
 
The main difference between the two standards is ISO 45001 takes a proactive approach that requires hazard risks to be evaluated and remedied before they cause accidents and injuries, while OHSAS 18001 takes a reactive approach that focuses solely on risks and not solutions.
