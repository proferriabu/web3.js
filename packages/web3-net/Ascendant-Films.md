**The Divergent Series: Ascendant** was supposed to wrap up the sci-fi saga, but Divergent 4 was abandoned, leaving the series unfinished. Following the success of The Hunger Games franchise, there was a slew of short-lived movie adaptations of young adult sci-fi novels, including The Divergent Series. Based on the best-selling series by Veronica Roth, the Divergent movies featured a cast of up-and-coming actors, including Shailene Woodley, Miles Teller, and Zo Kravitz. The series ended abruptly when the fourth Divergent movie was canceled with the intention of beginning a new television project, leaving the questions of the final Divergent book unanswered.
 
The Divergent series is set in a futuristic society where people are divided into factions based on their virtues: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, and Erudite. Those who don't fit are "divergent." While Divergent and its sequel The Divergent Series: Insurgent were hits, they failed to match the success as The Hunger Games. After the financial disappointment of The Divergent Series: Allegiant, the film's executives decided to try wrapping up the series with a TV movie version of The Divergent Series: Ascendant, which was rumored to kill off Shailene Woodley's Tris to continue the story in a television series.

Prior to the release of The Divergent Series: Allegiant, there were already signs that the general public's interest in the franchise was waning. The second movie only topped the original's total gross by a tiny margin. When Allegiant grossed less than $180 million worldwide, compared to the $300 million Insurgent made the year before (via Box Office Mojo), the studios realized they could no longer confidently invest in the YA dystopian movies for a considerable profit at the box office.
 
The first movie in the series was estimated to cost $80 million, while the third had a budget of $110 million. Even with a move to TV, the audience would have expected the same quality as the movies, something that was unlikely to happen if the budget was cut drastically.
 
Cast members like Miles Teller and Zoe Kravitz were already moving on to bigger roles and projects, so the odds of convincing them to return were always slim. Splitting the last Divergent book into two films was ultimately what killed the series' conclusion, and demonstrates the danger of splitting a story into two parts. For if the first film doesn't do well financially, then the series will ultimately be abandoned and disappoint both the filmmakers and the audience.
 
Certainly one of the factors in the early end to the Divergent series and the cancelation of Divergent4 was the critical response. Despite the popular source material, a strong cast, and solid initial box office, the Divergent movies were never well-regarded by critics. Divergent began with a lukewarm 41% on Rotten Tomatoes, and regardless of the strong box office, that was not a strong way to kick off the franchise. Sadly, the critic scores went down from there, with Insurgent earning 28% and Allegiant earning 11%.
 
In general, **the negative reviews pointed to the lack of originality in the series** which was accused of adhering too much to a YA formula. Bad reviews are not always enough to sink a franchise, but when the reviews continue to decline as the series goes on, it usually doesn't bode well for future movies. Indeed, the reviews also made the cast members less enthusiastic about continuing on with many of the actors openly admitting the franchise had lost its way.
 
While it seems like The Divergent Series: Ascendant is unlikely to ever be revived as a project, Hollywood loves a known brand name with an established fan base, and it will be difficult to imagine the Divergent franchise not returning to the screen in some form down the line. Considering there are multiple streaming services vying for audience attention, Divergent could make a comeback on a streaming platform.
 
With the Percy Jackson franchise rebooted on Disney+, another streaming service may reboot the Divergent series to keep up with the competition. So, even though Summit Entertainment, which owns the rights to the franchise, will not be reviving the sci-fi saga anytime soon, that does not mean that the property will be dead forever. After all, the Divergent movies were still profitable, making over $765 million worldwide.
 
As with my review of the second movie in the series, Mythica: The Darkspore, I will not waste time here with background information. For more information on the Mythica series and on Arrowstorm Entertainment itself, check out my reviews of the previous two films in the series: Mythica 1, Mythica 2.
 
While the main plot of the film, until near the end, is technically what a game would likely label a side-quest, I really enjoyed the darker tone both that plot and the conflict with Szorlok and his forces at the end. While there have been deaths in this series before, it still felt fairly lighthearted, and you were reasonably certain that the main cast was going to emerge unscathed. Without spoiling anything, this film went to a much darker place, as befits the middle of the series, which served to impart on viewers that there is indeed a serious threat to the world that our heroes must face, and that victory is not assured.
 
My review of the next film should follow soon, and then I hope to finally get back to posting here regularly again. For real this time, and with posts beyond book and movie reviews. Until then, keep on reading and writing, and feel free to follow me on Twitter @YakovMerkin , where I more regularly post about various things, including writing and other genre stuff.

But Schwentke insiders say he exited Ascendant because he needed a break after doing the two films back to back and wanted to spend more time with his family in Los Angeles rather than go back to Atlanta. Production on the fourth and final Divergent film is scheduled to start in Atlanta in the summer.

Theo James, Ansel Elgort and Miles Teller also star in in the movie series that is based on the best-selling YA novels by Veronica Roth. Naomi Watts also is onboard for Ascendant, which closes out the four-movie franchise. The two previous Divergent films have earned $586 million worldwide at the box office, with the first pic helmed by Neil Burger, who was replaced by Schwentke.
 
Krieger wrote and directed The Vicious Kind, which premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and earned him an Independent Spirit Award nomination for best screenplay. He then directed Celeste and Jesse Forever, based on a script written by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack, which starred Jones and Andy Samberg. That movie also premiered at Sundance.
 
When Shailene Woodley and co reach the final stage of their Divergent journey, they'll be doing it without director Robert Schwentke. The man who has so far handled Insurgent and Allegiant (the second a third films respectively), has decided not to return for Ascendant.
 
That's despite previously planning to stay on board for the rest of the franchise adapted from Veronica Roth's books. So why the change? There's no official statement yet, but Deadline has heard that the grueling demands of the dystopian sci-fi films means he needs a break.
