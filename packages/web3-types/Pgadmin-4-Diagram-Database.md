The video demo here - =2pxVCzRFGeg is very useful to get a brief introduction of the ERD tool in pgAdmin 4. The video was recorded long ago and since then the pgAdmin 4 team has introduced many improvements and features based on users feedback.

Once you save, you will see something like the screenshot below. You can double click the table to open the dialog again and make changes. You can also reorder the columns using the drag handle on the column row.
 

The ERD tool has many other useful features like Adding notes to the table nodes, changing the background color to help grouping nodes, many to many relationships, exporting the ERD to an image file and many more. To read more about it, you can check out \_tool.html
 

pgAdmin 4 allows you to create an ERD in a few simple steps. The pgAdmin team welcomes any suggestions or improvements that can be done. To log a request please visit -org/pgadmin4/issues/new


 
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) tool is a database design tool that provides a graphical representation of database tables, columns, and inter-relationships. ERD can give sufficient information for the database administrator to follow when developing and maintaining the database. The ERD Tool allows you to:
 
Click the Generate SQL icon to generate the DDL SQL for the diagram and open a query toolwith the generated SQL ready for execution.You can select the option With DROP Table if you wish to have DROP Table DDL statements beforeeach CREATE Table DDL. You can see the option by clicking the down arrow beside the SQL button.
 
Click this button to open a many-to-many relationship dialog to add a relationship between thetwo tables. This option will create a new table based on the selected columns for the two relatingtables and link them.

The top bar has a details toggle button that is used to toggle column details visibility. There is also a note button that is visible only if there is some note added. you can click on this button to quickly change the note.
 
All other rows below the table name are the columns of the table along with data type. If the column is a primary key then it will have lock key icon eg. id is the primary key in above image. Otherwise, it will have column icon.
 
Upon double click on the table node or by clicking the edit button from the toolbar, the table dialog opens where you can change the table details. Refer table dialog for information on different fields.
 
Don't hold it against me, but I have a fond memory of MS SQL Server Management Studio. I could very easily generate an ERD diagram from an existing database. Tables, relationships, the works. You could even use the diagram to edit the database structure.
 
(I have found references to using Dia and other tools to model first and then generate the SQL to create the database. This is nice, but secondary to my primary goal which is to generate a diagram from an existing PostgreSQL database. And to truly replicate Management Studio functionality, the application would have to work in both directions.)

PostgreSQL, a.k.a. Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It has become popular for database development among major organizations such as Instagram, Skype, and Netflix.
 
Vertabelo understands the unique parameters of PostgreSQL. For instance, it knows the PostgreSQL naming conventions, data types, and constraints. As a design tool, it validates your physical model against the Postgres rules and alerts you for problems.
 
Vertabelo has all the essential features to create your logical and physical diagrams. They let you add new entities, various types of relationships, associations, and other components of your models.
 
You can share your models with anyone who has a Vertabelo account by simply providing the e-mail address. You can share models at three different access levels: Owner, Editor, and Viewer. You can change the access levels anytime. You can even share the model with people who do not have Vertabelo accounts, such as partners and customers, by creating a public link to your model and sending it to them via email.
 
Automated DDL file generation is one of the key features in this Postgres ER diagram tool. You can generate a PostgreSQL script to create or remove some or all elements of your database from the physical data model.
 
Vertabelo is an online tool for PostgreSQL with all the essential features a perfect ER diagram tool should have. Some essential features like support for remote and collaborative work, change management, and easy revisions, as well as ease of solving practical issues in database development enabled by these features, bring Vertabelo up to the highest rank among other competitors.
 
Reverse engineering is one of the key features of Navicat. It loads existing database structures of Postgres and many other supported DBMSs into the tool and creates a new ER diagram. Also, it visualizes database models without showing the actual data so that you can see how the elements such as attributes, indexes, and relationships relate to each other.
 
When you revise your data model in Navicat, its database synchronization feature compares the target database against the revised model. Then, the tool generates a script to update the changes into your database. You can customize the comparison and synchronization with its flexible settings.
 
Not only does Navicat create ER diagrams and design your database, but it also lets you generate SQL scripts through its Export SQL feature for individual parts of the model. This saves hundreds of hours of work.
 
Navicat is equipped with the essential standard features of a perfect data modeling tool and supports many popular DBMSs. In addition, the comparison and synchronization option speeds up database revisions. Integration with Navicat cloud enables you to sync your model files and give you real-time access from anywhere anytime. These features give Navicat an advantage that improves productivity for database architects.
 
Visual Paradigm is an online modeling tool that supports different sets of notations for various diagrams including data models. It supports PostgreSQL and many other DBMSs including MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Sybase, SQLite, HSQL, and MariaDB.
 
The Table Record Editor feature of this design tool enables you to enter sample records for the entities in the ERD. These sample records help users understand the formats of the data inserted into the database.
 
Like other PostgreSQL ER diagram tools discussed in this article, Visual Paradigm lets you generate DDL files from selected entities or from the entire ERD to create your physical database. It also has a feature for patching revisions made in the data model into the physical database. After analyzing the database, the Patch Tool creates the SQL script needed to patch the changes in the database.
 
Visual Paradigm has many of the common essential features that save time and improve productivity. The Patch Tool, which manages revisions efficiently, and the Table Record Editor, which helps you understand the data formats entered into the database, should delight database architects.
 
In SqlDBM, you can generate a DDL script from the physical model you create for PostgreSQL. Also, with its reverse engineering feature, you can copy and paste a DDL script or upload a DDL file generated from an existing PostgreSQL database. This creates a corresponding data model in SqlDBM to be edited visually.
 
You can share your SqlDBM diagrams with your team members and work on them collaboratively. You have to provide their email addresses to share your model. You can control the access levels by checking or unchecking a box.
 
SqlDBM has the essential features a perfect Postgres design tool should have. In particular, its Compare Revision feature helps database architects manage changes effectively. However, as a modeling tool, it needs improvements in model validation against PostgreSQL.
 
As a Postgres design tool, ERDPlus is most suited for modeling your data from scratch. It supports through the entire data modeling process, generating your physical model from the logical model automatically, generating SQL script for the physical data model, and exporting your diagrams to PNG format, among other capabilities. However, there are limitations in this tool, as it does not offer features such as reverse engineering and model validation against databases.
 
Lucidchart is an online multi-purpose diagramming tool that supports drawing many types of diagrams including ER diagrams. It supports PostgreSQL and many others like MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and Salesforce. So, we can consider Lucidchart a PostgreSQL ER diagram tool.
 
You have two options for creating your ER diagram in Lucidchart. You can create it manually fro
