I use the latest products and techniques and our quality is unmatched. I pride myself on quality, whether it be workmanship, materials or service delivery. Our shadow box frames are constructed with a solid wooden shadow box to ensure strength and durability.
 
Casting appointments are done at my studio in Karama in a private and comfortable setting. I also offer housecalls if you would like me to come to you. Just shoot me an email, call or message us on facebook.
 
The process itself is very gentle. Your child is required to submerge their hand/foot into the mould. It takes less than a minute to set and then we gently ease the hand or foot slowly out of the mould.
 
If there are delays in choosing matboard colours, frames, supplying a photo, hospital band, clamp, cot card, etc, you will need to wait that little bit longer as all orders are processed in date order. But rest assured, we will let you know.
 
Once we confirm the design, we are able to start your keepsake. A lot of the making is done in house in creating this special keepsake. We are cutting your mats, frame, glass, creating the shadowbox, printing the photo, engraving plaques and castings are being perfected and dried before sealing and finished in your choice of colour.
