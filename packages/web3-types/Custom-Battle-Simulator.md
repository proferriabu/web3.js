Hello everyone.

While I'm a decent pilot at realistic and understand what specific planes can do and what not I'm really bad in simulator mode games.
I have about 17 hours gameplay in simulator and I know that this isn't much but the problem is that I don't think that I made any progress in getting better.
 
So I usually end up playing realistic mode again. (Also because it to takes ages to find a game only to see that 80% of the enemies are bombers or ground attackers with turrets which kill me every time. But that's not the point right now)

Even if I can motivate myself to try it again it usually ends like this: I often die (or the game ends) without getting a kill or an assist and if I spot someone I usually mess up either my approach or my shoting. Either way I tend to lose the target from my sight and likely get shot down later.

After many games trying out different aircraft I atleast found a plane which I really enjoy: the Fw 190 A-4 (even If I don't do well in it).

Well... after all that whining out of my system I can finally ask you guys what I wanted to: Is there any way to train aiming, spotting, boom'n zooming and so on for simulator battles without having to fight Yak-3 pilots with 10+ days experience or a horde of B-25s?
Also as a sidenote: I don't know anyone who flies simulator so to squad up with an experienced pilot is not really an option for me.
 
And as a rule of thumb, I'd say that most pilots can put up a fight on a regular basis after about 50 flight hours. That means that most count as "easy opponents" instead of "swap ammo for kill here" from then. So not being able to do much after 17 hours isn't all that bad.
 
as FourGreenFields said custom missions are a great opportunity to train your aim. If you configure wingsmans there they will always try to follow you no matter what. try to shoot them down. it helps to learn some basic maneuvers for defensive flying.
 
and the rest comes with experience, you will learn with every flight, even if you dont notice yourself. and often progress as pilot comes in steps, in breakthroughs. so dont be too hard to yourself if you dont see any fast progress atm. you will take the next step sooner or later (as long as you are willing to learn, and try to think about what you have done wrong after every death and how you could have done it better)
 
try to stay alive as the main objective in the beginning. the kills will come, dont try to push it. concentrate on surviving first (dont understand this as hiding in bushes for round end..i guess you get the point)
 
well you got 1/4 of the flying time of him in SIM, a bit thin basis to advise other people in sim, dont you think. yaks are a very bad training vehicle for sim. you dont learn to behave right in sim. no need to watch stalls, being conservative with energy etc
 
Self-reflection is the key. Whenever you die it's always tempting to jump into the next fight straight away, but stopping to think about what you did wrong and what you could have done about it works best when the memory is fresh in your mind. Maybe you pulled too hard at the wrong moment, lost visual on your killer, poor situational awareness etc. In each one of these cases you can at least understand a little of what you might have done to live a little longer. 

Build your knowledgebase of both aerodynamics and combat maneuvers bit by bit. The first time you look through ACM you might think you understand, but when it actually hits home is when you realized you did it, or you realize the other guy did it to you.

IMO that's the exciting part of simming :) Not so much the kills. Though tis nary a bad goal to eventually break even on one's KDR. I can dream! ;\_;
 
For pure shooting accuracy training I would suggest starting a custom battle with plenty of AI bots and unlimited ammo. Then try to shoot down as many as you can, both enemies and friendlies. It will not help you much to improve your skills in energy retention, manouvers etc, but might be helpful to improve accuracy and spotting.

I second this. My rule has usually been 50 SB games, but very similar. Keep playing as much as you can tolerate before you go back to RB, but dont force yourself to play SB or a specific aircraft. No reason to burn yourself out.
 
As you already know, each plane has its own strengths and weaknesses. Learn those of your favored plane (the Anton) BUT also take the planes that you're flying against up for a spin. The more you know their weaknesses, the more likely you'll be able to exploit them in a dogfight. For example if I've got a 190 on my tail, I know that if I can get the pilot to manoeuver on or near the buffet, a sudden change of direction is all I need to get my pursuer to flick it into a spin -and that's often fatal in that type. So which ever planes you're coming across most often, take them up on a test flight and see where their blind spots are, how do they handle in a turn, in a climb, how they roll at low speed, at high, etc...
 
One good way for you to practice is to turn RB into SB lite. Fly in RB from the cockpit, and turn off the aids (inc radar) -the FM won't be the same but you'll sharpen a lot of the other skills you need.
 
But nothing beats actually flying in SB to hone those skills. Just expect some days to be miserable. Everyone goes through a slump -even the best pilots in SB have all had a week without a kill. And sometimes you run into a plane that just doesn't work for you. For me it was your favourite -the Fw-190. It took me 48 missions to get my first kill in that thing. You're bound to be much better than that. So am I, just not in that plane. (Except the D-9/12 -loving those two)
 
So don't give up, even when it seems like you're the worst pilot in WT SB (you're not btw, We all know who that is... cough purple cough) Just think of it as "every time you get killed, it's a chance to learn an important skill" -something the guys who flew these for real almost never got a chance to do
 
USSR= if japanese are easy mode, this is god mode, this is acutally the nation for idiots i was talking about i started with them and im not proud of that :P... anyone that have 100000 kills and plays only Russians is not skileld pilot, but just dude that cant play anything else... they are UFO simply explained, if you try to zoomb climb they behave like helicopter turn like Japanese and are fast as US, never go aginst them in German planes, and + cause this is gaijin game flaks wont kill them and this is not joke or something like that, flaks simply fire at them but they are set up not to hit them at all...
