As we read on, it becomes clear that the house is not the only thing strange about this story. The secluded, rented country home and the attic room the narrator inhabits come to represent or symbolize her situation and her very self.

The play follows the lives of seven Black women who are identifiable based on the colors of their dresses: Lady in Red, Lady in Orange, Lady in Blue, Lady in Brown, Lady in Yellow, Lady in Purple, and Lady in Green. The nameless women battle issues concerning love, empowerment, struggle, and loss throughout the play.
 
**The history of the classic feminist novel is centred around women writing about women. At a time when female voices were scarcely heard, many women writers were quietly paving the way for modern feminism, using their literature as a platform.**
 
Helen Graham escapes an abusive marriage with her small child and embarks on a fearless journey of self-discovery and romance. Deemed controversial upon publication, the story deals with feminist themes like domestic abuse, female autonomy, and the right to free will and happiness.
 
This classic feminist book captures what it meant to be an immigrant in early twentieth-century America. Cather successfully re-wrote the American female narrative through the lens of the frontier woman, breathing fresh life into the well-told pioneer chronicle.
 
The story focuses on a bold, independent woman who dominates a rugged landscape and outperforms her male counterparts. Headstrong and iron-willed, Alexandra Bergson is devoted to securing success for her loved ones after inheriting the family farm. Her pioneering spirit reflects the struggles of women in the American frontier through a prominently feminist representation of female strength and persistence.

The fiery blonde protagonist epitomises the newly independent woman of the 1920s: wearing tight clothes, keeping her hair short, and smoking in public. The work questions the dual motivation of men who pursue women for their beauty and women who pursue men for their money, revealing the hypocrisy and commodification behind social relationships.
 
Often marked as the first literary text to explore transgender characters, the tale follows the titular character over a period of 300 years as he miraculously transforms from a man into a woman. Challenging traditional gender roles and dismissing societal expectations, this classic feminist novel stands up to the idea of gender binaries and the constraints of the patriarchy.
 
When critics read the novel as empowering, they focus on Alcott as a proud rebel against the 19th-century cult of domesticity and the sentimental Christianity upon which it rested. They see her as attempting to reform that world from within with a novel that rejected all the pre-emptive categorizations and premises that would have put it on a shelf alongside tracts like those referred to above. These are the critics who view Little Women as a female utopia, free from any male intrusion.
 
Most sentimental novels of the era, if they addressed young parenthood at all, glossed over it as a blissful experience full of cooing babies and maternal smiles. Alcott introduces the reality of hard work to this fanciful picture.
 
Thank you, Elizabeth. A mature critique of a work of literature focussing on womanhood by a Christian woman.
You probably did not choose the headline, which would be better described by female 'maturation' rather than that hackneyed political word 'empowerment'. Married to a doctor and having 4 sisters and three daughters I appreciate your analysis of the book and conclude that it is a perennial classic for the reasons you expound.
 
If I may make one suggestion, by all means recommend it to your sons but for the love of God do not push Wuthering Heights upon them. All male characters are cardboard cut-outs and caricatures of men and not knowing that, being forced to study it in early high school almost caused me a nervous breakdown.
 
Are there other scholars who present the nature of female human nature in similar fashion that you could recommend? I mean, really examining the inner life of femaleness which is truly a mystery to wise men.
 
I remember reading Little Women when I was in grade school, and I thought it was great, but I felt I had to read Little Men. I was very disappointed that it wasn't anywhere as near as good a book. It taught me that titles are good, but they don't guarantee the content
 
Your review reminded me how influential Little Women was on my life. I think I read it for the first time in 4th or 5th grade. I reread it several times over several years. Jo was a revelation to me. I smiled often in recognition over the way she relished getting away with a new book, her writing parts for herself as the hero in their family plays, her independence and her bravery. Amazing for a young Latina growing up in East Los Angeles. As a Latina, I connected with picture of family being the source of strength and comfort, whether or not you were the "second Mom", the"rebel", the "meek one" or the "beauty queen". I loved Jo's friendship with Laurie, a strong bond that didn't have to be romantic or overly dependent. And besides all of that I learned a tremendous amount of American historical information, including that "blancmange" is actually vanilla pudding! I agree with your review. Whether she was aware of it or not, Ms Alcott gave girls ( even through the mid-twentieth century) a picture of what strong women could be.
 
For me, being a feminist simply means I am a strong, independent woman who has ideas and thoughts of her own; but it also means something else, which is an idea that confuses even me. I mean, how could I be a feminist when I am also a conservative woman?
 
Emily Dickinson was born and raised in Amherst, MA, and had the privilege of being well-educated. Her father had made it clear that writing and being published was not a suitable goal nor occupation for a young woman in the latter part of the 19th century. Perhaps this is why only a dozen of her over 1800 poems were ultimately published. In fact, the rejection was difficult for her, and this is where I find I can empathize with her. She had been reclusive, yes, and rumored to be odd, only dressing in white, and refusing to see house guests who came to her home. Yet, after much reading and watching several biopics, I found her to be quite refreshing. She felt misunderstood it seems and afraid to reveal who she really was for fear of rejection. Perhaps that is why she was so private, especially about her love life.
 
Women were sometimes silenced in ancient texts, and that has been ignored for hundreds of years in classrooms around the country. When we begin to see that we need a modern, progressive, and in my opinion, a feminist perspective, we can truly understand how culture affects education and thought process. When we start to add the feminist lens, we can see how dangerous and downright ignorant it can be to solely focus on single viewpoints.
 
This autoethnographic essay is a further extension of my M.A graduate thesis completed in July 2021. It is a personal response to the questions and issues concerning what it means to be a teacher in the 21st century amidst cultural turmoil regarding issues rooted in classical antiquity. It is a fusion of personal experience, both culturally and educationally, and finds inspiration from my first year teaching experience at an all female school that espouses conservative values, and a less than diverse curriculum. Its aim is to promote all educators and scholars to look for progressive ways to teach classical literature using a feminist lens to help understand the root of slavery and misogyny in our societies. It is also an admission to the struggle of being open about being a conservative woman who has strong feminist values, and loves literature and its study and instruction.
