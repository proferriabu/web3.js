The Grand Piano Canyon sessions marked the genesis of the group that eventually came to be known as Fourplay. Their self-titled debut album was released in 1991, and included a blend of jazz, R&B and pop.
 
The sense of experimentation continued with the 2002 release of Heartfelt. The material in this set emerged from a series of improvisational performances that were assembled into full compositions. As a result, the tunes have less clearly defined melodies, but the overall album is both exploratory and accessible at the same time.
 
After 12 years with the group, Carlton left in April 2010 to delve further into his solo career, and the band welcomed its newest member, multi-faceted virtuoso guitarist, Chuck Loeb. His musical contributions undoubtedly enhance the creativity and pursuit of excellence Fourplay has enjoyed in the studio and on the stage.
 
Fourplay is a renowned contemporary jazz group that has captivated audiences worldwide with their unique fusion of smooth jazz, R&B, pop, and funk. The group was formed in 1990 and consists of four incredibly talented musicians: Bob James (keyboardist), Nathan East (bassist and vocalist), Harvey Mason (drummer), and Chuck Loeb (guitarist). Each member brings their own distinct musical style and expertise to the ensemble, resulting in a cohesive and dynamic sound.
 
The origins of Fourplay trace back to a recording session where Bob James and Harvey Mason collaborated on James' album. Impressed by their musical chemistry, they decided to form a band and invited Nathan East to join them. Later, guitarist Lee Ritenour became a founding member, but when he departed in 1998, Chuck Loeb replaced him, solidifying the lineup that has remained to this day.
 
Fourplay released their self-titled debut album in 1991, which quickly gained popularity and achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success. The album showcased their exceptional musicianship and featured smooth jazz hits like "Max-O-Man" and "After the Dance." This initial success set the stage for a string of highly successful albums, including "Between the Sheets," "Elixir," and "Esprit de Four," which further solidified their reputation as one of the leading contemporary jazz acts.
 
Over the years, Fourplay has collaborated with numerous renowned artists, including Chaka Khan, El DeBarge, Anita Baker, and Eric Clapton, among others. Their live performances are known for their captivating energy and virtuosity, captivating audiences with their intricate musical interplay and improvisation.
 
Fourplay's enduring popularity and success in the contemporary jazz genre can be attributed to their ability to evolve while staying true to their musical roots. Their albums often blend various genres, incorporating elements of jazz, R&B, and pop, appealing to a wide range of listeners.
 
Tragically, on July 31, 2017, Chuck Loeb passed away after a battle with cancer, leaving a void in the band. In 2019, guitarist and vocalist Larry Carlton joined Fourplay, bringing his own exceptional talent and adding a new chapter to the group's storied history.
 
With their remarkable musicianship, captivating performances, and a discography spanning over three decades, Fourplay continues to be a beloved and influential force in contemporary jazz, enchanting audiences around the world with their smooth, soulful sound.

This all-star group -- comprised of keyboardist Bob James, guitarist Lee Ritenour, bassist Nathan East, and drummer Harvey Mason -- was formed in 1991 after the quartet came together on part of James' Grand Piano Canyon album. They have since recorded for Warner Bros. that have all been big sellers -- not surprising considering the popularity of James and Ritenour. Larry Carlton took over the guitarist's spot in the late '90s, first appearing in Fourplay on the band's successful 1998 album, 4. The seasonal Snowbound was released in 1999. It featured traditional and modern holiday songs, all played in the quartet's increasingly slick style. The band ended its tenure with Warner Bros. with 2000's soft babymaker album Yes, Please. Fourplay attempted to break new ground with 2002's Heartfelt, which was their debut album for RCA's Bluebird imprint. The album consisted of live studio jamming that was heavily edited and assembled using Pro Tools. In 2004 they issued Journey, more a return to their earlier, smoother form than a building-block progression from Heartfelt. In 2006, Fourplay released X, a final album for RCA/Bluebird. The set featured a guest vocal from Michael McDonald on a reading of Steve Winwood's "My Love's Leavin'." The group signed with Heads Up International for 2008's Energy, which was notable for a pair of excellent Carlton compositions and a vocal appearance by Esperanza Spalding on "Prelude for Lovers." Fourplay -- now featuring new guitarist Chuck Loeb replacing Carlton -- assembled again for the label on 2010's Let's Touch the Sky, which included guest appearances by Ruben Studdard and Anita Baker. Two years later, they released Esprit de Four, with guest appearances by Kenny Mason & the Voices of Praise Choir, and Japanese singer Seiko Matsuda. In 2015, Fourpl
