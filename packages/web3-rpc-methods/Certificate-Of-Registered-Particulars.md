Under Regulation 4(2) of the Regulations, the Commissioner for Transport shall, on payment of a prescribed fee, supply to any person making application for any particulars in the register in respect of a vehicle a certificate stating such particulars.

The information obtained from the register of vehicles shall, unless with the consent of the owner, only be used for purpose(s) that conform with the purpose(s) of the register of vehicles and purpose(s) as specified in the application for the Certificate.

**The Companies Act 2014 (the "Act") proposes to amend existing company law provisions that stipulate that a certificate of registration of a charge issued by the Companies Registration Office ("CRO") constitutes conclusive evidence that compliance has been made with statutory requirements to deliver particulars of that charge to the CRO.**
 
The effect of the amendment will be that the certificate will not constitute conclusive evidence of a charge over any property or properties where the particulars delivered to the CRO in respect of that property or properties fail to meet the required standard. In this regard, the section stipulates that "property" includes an interest in, or a right over, property. The Act does not give significant guidance on what particulars of property must be delivered except for stipulating in Section 414 (1) (e) that the particulars required to be registered by the CRO include "short particulars of the property charged".
 
The current position is that a certificate of registration of a charge constitutes conclusive evidence of compliance with the charge registration requirements in the Companies Acts 1963 to 2013. The courts have been asked to decide on what "conclusive evidence" means in this context on a significant number of occasions. As a result, the courts have decided that, because of the conclusiveness of the certificate, the mortgage or charge to which that certificate relates is effective against all interested persons according to the terms of that mortgage or charge, even if the particulars of it submitted to the CRO are inaccurate as to the amount secured, or the property secured by the mortgage or charge, or the name or identity of the company which has created the mortgage or charge, or the date on which it was created.
