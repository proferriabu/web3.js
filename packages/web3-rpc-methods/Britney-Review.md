Britney Spears, the Princess of Pop, sits down in this memoir and finally gets to tell her side of the story. Most know by now that Britney spent her entire 30s (13 years of her life, to be exact) in a conservatorship controlled by her father when she was forced to work gruelling hours, and make millions of dollars for the members of her family without having a say in any aspect of her life (including pregnancy as she was forced to have an IUD and by LAW was not allowed to remove it). She was manipulated and taken advantage of by the people who should have been there to protect her. And while I don't know how she can ever repair the relationships we had with all of her family (although I do see she has started to mend her relationship with her mother and brother), she has been a victim to an entire world, not just the Spears household.
 
Several documentaries show how disrespected she was by the media, other stars, and friends. Go back and watch that Diane Sawyer interview if you're able, and you'd be appalled that a "respected journalist" would ask such low-brow, sexualized questions of a young girl. This was gaslighting and narrative-creating to the extreme. We turned this talented, kind young lady into a sex symbol and then vilified her for it, and in this book, reading her side of the story makes it all feel even more shameful.

This book is poorly written. At first, I questioned why she wouldn't have gotten a ghostwriter. Still, honestly, after spending the majority of her life without a voice (ironic considering she's a singer, but you know what I mean), I get why she would want to be the one to write this herself. It is, at best, the equivalent of a tenth-grade essay - I mean no disrespect, I think she is brilliant; it's just hard to write when you're still so very much in the thick of the experience and not on the other side of it like you might believe.
 
I compared this memoir and Matthew Perry's over the weekend. Matthew Perry wrote with a precise and painstaking awareness of who he was, what he had become and how he needed to get through it (extra sad to think about now that he has passed away). He was someone who had done the work and worked through his mental health issues and addictions and wrote about it in a frank way. Britney's memoir is a lot like Prince Harry's book "Spare" They both write as people who have already gotten through the hardship of their life and processed their grief and trauma - they write as if it's already done, not realizing that they are still in the thick of it. Which makes both reads, like the mindset, very immature. All I can hope for both Britney and Harry is that the book's writing process helps them identify the work that is still to come.
 
This autobiography also made me hate Justin Timberlake. I know, I'm sorry. I realize he was a kid at the time, and I know I've only heard her side, but I also lived it. I saw him rise to fame because of his breakup with Britney, as the world vilified her. Do I blame him for taking advantage of this for his success - yeah, I do. And perhaps he's apologized now, but it's too late. He could have defended her and still been a star, but instead, he used her back as a stepping stool and kicked her once he got up. It isn't enjoyable and has forever changed how I think of him.
 
If I'm being honest, though, Britney's story has changed how I think and feel about many people and things. I spend a lot of time questioning the state of the world we currently live in, and while there are a lot of things to worry about when it comes to attitudes and media and the cultures of cancelling and influencing, at least we don't see history repeating itself on the same level when it comes to our sexualization and disrespect of young girls in the public spotlight. We don't live in a world where it's okay to do that anymore, at least not without fear of being cancelled. Maybe that is something to be happy about in a world with great unhappiness.
 
I don't think you have to be a huge fan of Britney Spears to enjoy "The Woman in Me," and you don't have to be a big reader either, but I think for any of us who lived even a tiny part of her time in the spotlight, it is worth it. It may only get three generous stars for writing, but it's a five-star review for honesty and insight.
 
Oddly enough, I would imagine the compelling energy of her personal story is enough to make this a bestseller. As mental illness does not run in my family IT GALLOPS, my choice would be to NOT read it. All that being said, I truly appreciate this review.

Although I have no interest in her as a pop star (nor did my daughters, as far as I know), I am somewhat interested to read the book because in a long ago distant time I knew the woman who was the judge overseeing her case. I imagine she will not come off well in the book, so I am reluctant to read it for that reason.
 
I wanted to provide my review and I completely mean this all in a very sincere and honest way. I know several people feel some kind of way about me but I wanted to share my fresh genuine take on the book.
 
The book does not go into much detail about the conservatorship or post conservatorship. She briefly will mention a few things but it isn't much. The overall sense is she was deprived from her life without getting truly in full detail (besides here and there).
 
Sam/Hesam is almost obsolete from her book. I was hoping to have more of a glimpse into the dynamic of their relationship during and post c-ship. I would have love to hear more about their love journey especially in such dire situations. Of course now they are divorcing, you feel his existence is missing from it plus why they divorced (which I know the media said it was too late to edit the book). The book needed more of their 6yr relationship.
 
I know the category of her children is a sensitive topic but I was hoping for more insight into the ups and downs in their relationship during the c-ship. Nothing is mentioned as to why things are the way they are currently. I understand she doesn't have to but it is a tell-all.
 
While I know it's difficult, I wanted to hear more about the really crappy mistreatment she dealt with at the hands of her father and team to highlight even more (which she did a good job of) of what a giant P O S he and that "team" were. The world deserves to have the RAW truth about how disgusting him, Lou, Robin, Lynn, the courts etc.
 
She truly was self sabotaging herself and her own image out of retaliation. She wore those awful wigs, dancing was subpar and robotic - on purpose as rebellion (and the heavy meds) to protest against those disgusting people. For years so many people saying, she can't dance anymore, she's a zombie etc. She gave up/rebelled!!!
 
There were several parts (c-ship) that I yelled aloud about "How could that be allowed to happen/how was this ok/how did no one do a damn thing?" It sickens me that her rights were stolen from her for years and nothing a MF thing was done by ANYONE!!! The hundreds if not thousands of people who were around her for 13 years - no one did anything to help this human being! It enrages me (I can only imagine her anger).
 
I find it hard to believe that people have issues with the book, but I'm not surprised at this point; once again, the same people who blame Britney for not meeting their expectations are the ones with issues.
 
Ultimately, when you live your life in the spotlight, people are going to know the headlines, and Britney, having a 25 year career, isn't an exception to that and thats without everything else beyond her celebrity ststus. we know the major events, the headlines and what others did and said. However, we never knew what Britney herself felt like, thought or wanted to say. This is the books purpose...
 
The book is compact with her views and experiences, and is very clear and concise in its statements. Its candid and conversational, she doesn't attack, but she is very reflective, on herself and others. She doesn't paint herself as some eternal victim, and does the opposite; she lays her past out honestly.
 
I get that people may have wanted her to talk about the indepth details of each album, but this is less about the work, and more about her. Why doesn't she talk about BJ? Because she's talking about her attitude towards having no creative outlet and how she dealt with it around that time, and that is only one example. Why would she detail working on album when she made it clear she wasn't interested in it, Particularly when she's so proud of the work she did on BOMT, Blackout and Glory?
 
When it comes to the conservatorship, why would she detail the legal details when she was kept in the dark on all of her rights, and couldn't freely access information? She details her experiences, how she felt and how those around her made her feel. I mean. That's what i wanted to hear.
 
There's a sense that people wanted a level of sadism to her story and that's wrong, I mean she literally talks about being institutionalised twice, and being expected to go back to work the next day like nothing happened. This isnt fiction, its her literal life.
 
I am so shocked that everyone is eating this book up. Why are so many details taken from other articles written about Britney? Why is her recollection of events always lining up with details from famous unauthorized articles? Like, do you really think something Christina said in a Rolling Stone interview in 2003 is really top of mind? Do you think that she remembers what movie she was watching 20+ years ago before getting married in Vegas?
 
If you read The 2008 Britney article from Rolling Stone, so much of it lines up with what she's saying in the book, but in a way that makes it seem like the ghostwriter wrote it for her based on researching what
