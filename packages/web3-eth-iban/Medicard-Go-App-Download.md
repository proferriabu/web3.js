My girlfriend who is Canadian went through this exercise last February and had to end up getting private health insurance here instead. She has a full 4 year work visa so as a casual traveller I doubt you would qualify.

There are limits of what is available through the reciprocal agreements, so check the Medicare website! It's always worthwhile checking the offical website, as other websites with information on it may become out of date and are probably not so thorough.
