The number nine and dragons are very important in Chinese culture. This particular wall is made of glazed tile from China and is modeled after the wall in Beihai Park in Beijing. The Chinatown mural replicates the large dragons and over 500 smaller dragons painted in red, gold and blue signifying the Chinese focus on good fortune. The Nine Dragon Wall is one of the only three such replicas outside of China.

The only seen users of the Ring of the Nine Dragons is Jack Spicer, Omi and Mala Mala Jong. Since the ring can split a person into nine people fragments, rather than duplicates, each person seemed to have their own personality though lacking what the whole person had.
 
When combined with either the Ying or Yang Yo-Yo, the user could leave their good/bad self inside the Yin Yang World, as seen with Good Jack Spicer when he was retrieving Chi from said world and used the ring to make a second Good Jack to distract the Yin Yang Creature. In a later episode, the Life and Times of Hannibal Bean, Jack, turned evil from his last visit with the Yin Yang World, met with his good self then Raimundo used the Shen Gong Wu to reunite the two real Jacks.
 
The Ring of the Nine Dragons was also used by Mala Mala Jong to split himself into the Fearsome Four. Although this had the effect of replicating the Shen Gong Wu that made up its body, it also resulted in minor variances, as certain members of the Fearsome Four used particular Sen Gong Wu that others did not.

Description
"Tsuzoku Suikoden Goketsu Hyakuhachinin no Hitori" (One Hundred and Eight Heroes of the Popular Suikoden All Told). Kyumonryu (nine dragons) Shishin (Shi-jin in Chinese). He was so nicknamed because of the nine-dragon tattoo on his back. He had enormous strength and was one of the great heroes in Suikoden. Here, he is battling with Chokanko (leaping tiger) Chintatsu (Chen Da in Chinese). 
This Suikoden series contains the first single-sheet color prints by any ukiyo-e artists. It is one of the most popular Suikoden series, which made Kuniyoshi famous.
 
To better enjoy this artwork, MFA Prints carefully selected nine sections of this masterpiece to highlight the individual dragons. Views 1 through 9 show the dragons from right to left, as traditionally read from the original hand scroll. Each section is available in all four standard sizes and our regular framing options.
 
Entres range from traditional such as fried rice, sweet-and-sour chicken, and kung pao chicken, but more contemporary Asian fare include peppery shrimp with spinach noodles, spit-roasted Beijing chicken with mashed taro and a mix-and-match noodle sampler.
 
The lobby features etched glass and gold artwork on one wall, depicting a pair of dragons playing with a golden ball. (The ball represents wisdom, and the dragons, representing people, are forever chasing it.) The dining room is brightened with colorful lanterns in pale greens, blues and reds and elegant glass sculptures from China backlit on one wall.
