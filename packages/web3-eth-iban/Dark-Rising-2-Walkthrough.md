The community, of course, the fan base has created incredible versions of complete Pokmon games in the form of Rom hacks with fantastic additions, new regions, mature storylines, and crazy difficulty spikes, which are played and loved by the fans.
 
One of the initial Legacy works of the Pokmon Rom Hacks was Pokmon Dark Rising, mainly created by DarkRisingGirl12. She made an entirely new storyline with exciting plot development around dark and edgy themes.

Pokmon Dark Rising starts with the God of Pokmon: Arceus, asking you, a young trainer, to help restore balance to the world that is being overrun by climate and seismic changes. That dream later leads you to go on the search for your father, who used to be the Hero of the region.
 
Your troubles are magnified when you realize that an evil organization is behind these evil deeds and will stop at nothing to achieve its goal. With the dream to become the strongest Pokmon trainer, rescue your father, and the goal to restore peace to the world, our player sets off on a journey.
 
This game is jam-packed with an all-new adventure waiting to be unfolded. The difficulty of the game has also been increased massively, with it having many battles with high-level Pokemon and trainers, even those with legendaries so get ready to polish your Pokemon skills and dive into the Core region.
 
The left ladder is where you go after this to fight the scientist, who will then let you choose a fossil to take. Be careful! These scientists have Level 30 Pokmon, and the level scaling is just madness. Take a fossil and then head towards the Atlantic Swamp.
 
Talk to the little girl if you want to trade a growlithe for a vulpix; if not, go down the sewers to encounter Max from the Hoenn anime. You will learn more about the evil organization from Max, then afterward, head back out and go east.
 
Now when you talk to the Shaman Gym lady, she will tell you to go to the SS Titanic, which is at the South of Mystic Falls. When you reach there, an earthquake will hit, and you will see V with his girlfriend sinking the ship (why name it Titanic.)
 
Go right from the city center and battle all the trainers while heading up; you also have a 1% chance of encountering a Treeko or a Snivy here. Follow the path upwards to get to Mystic Cave, where you can find a Totodile and your next big challenge, V.

He has all the children hostage, and his team is more than level 60, so be on your guard. Beat him to get the Jewel of life and save the children. Now we can head west since we have the Jewel of life.
 
Now you need to Press A in front of the statue in the middle. This will open the gate, go towards it and fall from the ceiling, then move towards the stairs to head down. Press A for the other statue here and then go up to the gate that was previously closed; it is now open.
 
Press A in front of the final statue, and as soon as you try to pass, someone will approach you; that is Amaris herself, who will challenge you to a battle. She will tell you to meet the gym leader and pick up the item at the table. From the graveyard, you will now enter into the Frozen Dungeon.
 
This place will be rough, but the silver lining is that there is a 1% chance of encountering a Piplup or Oshawott. Get the Shaman lady to heal your team, and on we go! Keep following the path and only fall through the ice at the top (it will break if you step on it twice.), climb the ladder, and then go down; the route is mapped as Up, Right, Down, and Left.
 
Now you reach the Plain field, as the name suggests, so try to get out of here to get to the Numassity path. After battling some trainers, you will see Pete, who is being mind controlled by Darugis, time to battle Pete.
 
Go up the stairs, and the girl will trade you the Poke Doll to teach a Pokmon Mimic, do that and trust me. Go into the second house and talk to the lady; she will award your endeavors with the move Psychic. Get a bike from the bike shop, and you are good to go. The pink building in the city is the actual Gym, and the Gym is the dojo.
 
This is where I found the third Pokmon I truly wanted for my team, and there is a 1% chance of encountering a Turtwig here. Battle the trainers and head directly to Novella Town. Talk to the fisherman in town, and he will give you a good rod.
 
The move deleter is in this town but more importantly, its time to fight the Gym. Before that, you will encounter Kayo, who calls you to Thunder Mountain for a final fight; welp! Time to fight the Gym.
 
Marshtomp and Charizard became my main Pokmon to handle situations like these. I was always just a bit over-leveled for these fights. Magnezone did faint my Charizard, but Torterra picked up the slack, and I won the battle.
 
As soon as you enter, you will talk to Misty, who will give you the HM surf. Go down and then leave to reach the islands; follow the path, and you will find Raikou along with Kayo, time for a gauntlet. Keep defeating trainers, and you will see Ash, who is engaged with Misty; she is mind-controlled by Darugis, fight Misty, who has a Suicune. Follow the path and go up the Mountain, where you will see Tarea guarding the path, head inside to meet with Arceus.
 
This path will lead you to the actual reality of the things you wish to accomplish, and you will also be able to catch Celebi. Follow the route, and the path will take you to Dark rising Headquarters. You will meet Florina, your rival, and Dray.
 
Learn the truth about Darugis and devise a strategy to face him. Your team has the Ruby and the Sapphire; all they need is the Emerald. The move relearner and Ultimate move tutor who teaches the starter Pokmon moves is here as well, so make use of that. You can also buy the mushrooms needed for this from the Poke Mart.
 
Climb the stairs to get to the next level and go left. Pick the second one to the left and then go down. Go left from that panel and go down; from the stopping floor, pick the first left and go down again to choose the up warp. Move slowly from that area to the one single block pointing up.
 
Next, go down and pick the first block that pushes you to the right, and you will reach where you need to be. Next to the grunt on the ground, you will see the lift key. Use the Key to head to B4F and talk to Kaiden and Sakura, who are mind controlled by Darugis.
 
He will tell you how Florina has been kidnapped, and your rival has gone after them to save her. As soon as you try to go after Florina, Pete tells you how the police found your HQ, and a fight broke out. Prioritizing things first, you tell Pete to go to the HQ while you go and rescue Florina.
 
Once you enter, you will see that the entire city is under the control of Dark Thugs. I almost started to feel burnout from this many battles, but the story was engaging; thugs will challenge you and Dray. Defeat them, and you can head North, East; this will take you to the Dark Rising headquarters once you have the Emerald. Otherwise, we were going North, West for another gauntlet.
 
Upon entering the factory, go down and rightwards, following the path to get the TM thunder. Come back to where you were from, follow the way towards the right, and then go up. When you reach a curve in which many stones surround you, you are on the right path; keep following it to reach Light, who is next to an electrical generator.
 
This is your final fight with him for the Emerald, so get ready because his Pokmon are level 90. Fly back to your HQ and give the Emerald to Sydney, who will then escort you to Millenium city and say goodbye for now. Honestly, I mean, you do so much, and they leave you to do nothing; well time to do what we should be doing, fighting the Gym.
 
Go inside the Gym, and you will find Florina and Tarea waiting for you. You will learn that Darugis has now influenced the Gym as well; you will probably need to fight most of the trainers here since Blitz has a Pokmon team with 96-level dragon monsters.
 
Everyone in the Malice Dungeon is very high level, and even the Pokmon is almost at level 90. You will find Fiery here, who is mind controlled by Darugis; she also has Pokmon in the 90s. Defeat her and see the Gym leader Typhoon, and after him go to Serena.
 
Answer: Trading in these games and trade evolutions have been removed since these games are hacked ROMs. All evolutions are based on leveling up your Pokmon. I believe you might still be able to trade Pokmon if you wanted to by using two emulators, but there is no need to do so since everything is already provided in-game.
 
Our Team has a collective Pokmon playtime of 10,000+ hours each, with detailed knowledge of the TCG meta, and various anime series. We collect Pokmon merch, celebrate special events with everything Pokmon, and are here to help others join the Pok Universe.
