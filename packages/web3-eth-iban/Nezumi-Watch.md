Fast forward, they succeeded, and their first run of 350 watches, broken into 3 colorways, is all but gone. The watch, the Voiture, had an immediate appeal to vintage chronograph appreciators. It spoke to some classic designs, namely that of the Omega Speedmaster and the Universal Geneve Compax, while still having its own style. It was sized well for a modern throwback at 40mm, featured the now-more-common Seiko Meca-Quartz VK63 movement, a sapphire crystal and an extremely reasonable price tag. Now, Nezumi is launching their second edition of the Voiture, which includes some minor changes. The pre-order price, including VAT, is 295 euros with a final price of 395 euros, which come to about $260\* $290 and $360 $400 w/o VAT respectively.

The dial of Voiture closely pulls from the UG Compax watches, but has some unique twists that give it its own personality. There are three models, two of the Panda variety and the blue one seen here. I found this one particularly appealing as the use of two, muted blues is quite unique, and the use of color, in general, was a bit more exciting. The main surface consists of a dark blue and light blue, both matte. Both have a desaturated, calm quality to them, which is a nice contrast from some of the louder blue dials that have come out in the last few years.
 
The lighter blue runs along the perimeter of the dial and then criss-crosses the center of the dial. This is a particularly interesting detail of the dial, as it speaks to some of the stranger chronograph designs, such as the Bulova Surfboard or Yema Rallygraf, which had odd shapes connecting the chronograph sub-dials. On the Voiture, the faceted hour-glass shape creates almost a mask across the dial, emphasizing the sub-dials at 3 and 9. This graphic in particular gives the Voiture a different look and feel, keeping it from being an homage to something specific rather than an era.
 
At 3, 6 and 9 are sub-dials for the 24-hr hand, active seconds and 60-minute counter, respectively. Obviously, this layout differs from the vintage norms, which would have had a 30-minute counter and a 12-hour counter. The sub-dials appear very deep, because they are actually a layer beneath the top surface, sandwich-dial style. This creates a very sharp and dramatic step down that makes the sub-dials really pop. Each sub-dial consists of an off-white surface with a mix of black markers and numerals, all encircled with a black line. They are cool looking, for sure, with a more bold take on the sub-dial than what would have been found on vintage chronos.
 
In fact, he was so taken by the Baleine that I was forced to reconsider my feelings. I was a bit surprised at his buoyant enthusiasm for it, but after he questioned me on the watch, I started to feel it a bit more myself:

And so Nezumi has kept the price lower than it might have done if it had been feeling a bit greedy, which is nice. What is nicer though, is the way the price difference between quartz and mechanical reflects where the bulk of the money has been spent in making these watches.
 
It shows us how cheap a component the movement and the module is in comparison to the rest of the product. This is exactly what I always preach goes into making a good brand in this price bracket. The movement is a necessary component, but it is not what makes the Nezumi brand tick. The design and execution thereof is everything. And so the Baleine gives us an automatic option for effectively nothing on top, while shifting the focus back (again and rightly so) to the way this thing looks.
 
One of my favorite aspects of the design is the polished (and nicely sized) handset. The hands are really nicely polished with a great luster at this price point. The painted tip of the polished seconds hand is a real easter egg that I enjoy looking at every time. Better still, the paint is luminous so it acts as a proper running indicator in the dark.
 
I adore the Nezumi case backs. I thought I would be bored by roughly the same design on so many models, but I just think it works. It is clean, it is clear, it is on-brand. For some reason, they remind me of old-fashioned tins of ammunition or produce from the heydey of packaging design. And speaking of the packaging, the Nezumi boxes are effectively works of art. I display all of mine in my office, quite proudly too, I might add.
 
The Nezumi Voiture Chronograph was the first watch made by Nezumi Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. It emerged on Kickstarter back in 2015. 243 backers brought the project to life and, if the other 242 backers feel the same as me, they will be glad they did. The 40mm case (excluding crown) has a lug-to-lug length of 47mm. Originally, the Voiture was 11.5mm thick including the domed sapphire crystal, but now, if you mine through the specs on the official website, you will see the current version is listed as 11.5mm thick excluding the sapphire.
 
How has that happened, you may wonder? Well, the crystal profile, among other small details, has been updated. In fact, these small updates (which include changes to the logo used on the dial and the accompanying text) are one of the things I really like about this watch. It is constantly evolving as David Campo, the founder revisits and improves their design.
 
The company is, thus far, best-known for its meca-quartz. And while a simple, time-only mechanical has made its way into the lineup (the Baleine model), a chronograph is significantly more challenging to implement without alienating an audience that is accustomed to a certain price point.
 
Nezumi pairs the Aviera GMT with a five-link jubilee-style bracelet in stainless steel. Rather than using the polished center links that usually define this style, Nezumi gives this dressy pattern a more aggressive edge with a fully brushed look that matches the case. Most of the rest of the bracelet design is exemplary, however, with a thick-milled clasp and solid links throughout. The one exception to the overall feeling of quality here is the endlink design, which mates to the case at a harsh 90-degree angle and does not follow the contours of the rest of the design. For consumers that prefer straps, Nezumi also offers the watch with a matching blue rubber tropic strap or a leather strap in black or brown.
 
The Nezumi Voiture takes heavy styling cues from several iconic racing chronographs of yesteryear. The most obvious is the Omega Speedmaster. Other inspired styling elements are a little more subtle paying tribute to mixture of vintage icons: Rolex Daytona, Zenith El Primero, Tudor Monte Carlo, and Heuer Monaco.
 
Although the dial creates incredible depth due to the sandwich construction and applied markers, there are a few issues with it. Like most chronographs, the Nezumi Voiture can have legibility issues at a quick glance. There is a lot going on in a compact package.
 
The beta version of the watch included a smooth black leather strap. I opted for the brown perforated racing strap (a special request at the time of my order). The brown and blues work well together. Weekend racers used to put holes in everything; seats, gloves, interior panels, etc. in hopes of shaving off another tenth of a second from their lap times.
 
One drawback of the VK63 is the elapsed hour counter sub dial is replaced with a 24-hour hand. I was very hesitant at first to add a quartz watch to my collection. This is disruptive to classic Southern hemispherical sub dial layout that we are accustomed to in a mechanical watch. After a month of deliberation (and a little research) I came to this conclusion: I would take the Seiko meca-quartz movement of the Nezumi over a Seagull mechanical every time.

Recently, I picked up this watch to be my casual and weekend wear. I wanted something unique looking, with a tachymetre on it. Nezumi is a brand I have seen for a while and their designs are top notch, so I decided on the Loews model after a lot of back and forth.
 
The Loews model I selected is REF. LQ1.302 with the brown leather strap. I wanted the more subtle Tachymetre design with the same color being used there and just the sub-dials popping in white. The face itself is a dark flat charcoal with depth being achieved via the sub-dials and applied indices.
 
Upon opening the sleek box the Aviera GMT came in, I was struck by how fresh it looks. In some ways, it feels familiar and in other ways, it feels exotic. The familiarity comes from the 24-hour scale engraved on the fixed stainless steel bezel and the lyre lug design. The novelty, on the other hand, comes from the dial layout and massive GMT hand, although the latter is unobtrusive given that its skeletonised. The lower part of the stem is painted black, as it is the case on the hour and minute hands, while the larger portion is painted yellow.
 
A 200 metres depth rating means you can comfortably dive with the Aviera, which is a good thing because it comes with generous applications of cream-coloured SuperLuminova on the hands and hour markers. And being a tool watch, it comes with a
