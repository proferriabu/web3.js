However, C5ISR networks are currently managed by combining separate software applications with dissimilar user interfaces and limited interoperability. This leads to complex and fragmented workflows, which ultimately places a major burden on the end user.

MissionOps Plan is a radio network planning and device configuration tool focused on ease of use. The modernization of the L3Harris Communication Planning Application (CPA), MissionOps Plan allows users to rapidly initialize communication assets and networks with hundreds of nodes and multiple waveforms.
 
MissionOps Sim is a network propagation simulation and modeling tool featuring dynamic route analysis. Sim provides multi-domain mission rehearsal and network availability prediction to mitigate PACE plan risks prior to deployment. Combined with MissionOps Plan, MissionOps Sim promotes success by ensuring the right mix and placement of operational resources.
 
L3Harris also expects to release future MissionOps modules, including an add-on for its hC2TM Battle Management Software Suite. The add-on will streamline hC2 network configuration workflows and display tactical network monitoring information as a layer within the command-and-control software, enhancing its common operating picture.
 
Studying the difference between the two diagrams, the first thing that you probably notice is the lack of point to point networks. The other thing that is not depicted from the diagram is that you do not need to configure a routing protocol to populate the dialogue box. That is covered by the mission plan configured in the CPA (communications planning application). It should be noted, you can use dynamic routing protocols with the 117G (RIP, OSPF), but that is another post for another time.
 
Project applications will be evaluated based on factors such as whether they improve safety, increase community connectivity, enhance access to emergency services, improve the mobility of goods, strengthen supply chains, and reduce noise. At least 20 percent of RCE Program funding (around $230 million this round) will also be set aside for projects located in rural communities or on Tribal lands, and around $38 million will be available to fund planning projects.
 
The Master of Urban Planning program has been training leaders in urban planning since 1965. After completing the program, our graduates can pursue professional opportunities in planning or a planning-related field. They may also pursue a doctoral degree.
 
Planners may work for a variety of organizations throughout their careers in the public, private, and non-profit sectors. Planners in the public sector work for municipalities, counties, state agencies, regional governments, and federal offices, while planners in the private sector work on public works or design projects alongside engineers, landscape architects, and architects. Planners in the non-profit sector typically work for advocacy groups related to fair and affordable housing, environmental protection, or multi-modal transportation.

The department and school both offer both scholarships and assistantships to students. About one-third to one-half of students receive some sort of assistance. Assistantships in the department involve a 20-hour a week work commitment and include a monthly stipend (salary). Scholarships range from $1,000 to $10,000. All applicants are departmentally considered for financial assistance without an additional application needed.
 
To be given first consideration for admission into the MUP program, please submit your application in the Texas A&M GradCAS portal by January 15. All applications received by January 15 will be reviewed for fall admission and be given full consideration for financial aid (including our recommendations for graduate assistantships and scholarships). The MUP program only admits students for entry in the fall.
 
We will begin our formal review of MUP applications after January 15. Applicants can expect a response letter from our department regarding a decision on their application sometime between late February and mid-March. A separate offer letter will follow if financial aid is being offered. April 15 is our deadline for applicants to return offer letters to LAUP to indicate their intention to study urban planning at Texas A&M University.
 
The Master of Urban Planning program educates and trains leaders in identifying community values, providing choices, and creating ethical solutions for a sustainable future. A student who graduates from Texas A&M with an MUP degree will be able to:
 
While our program has a long-standing reputation for providing municipal and regional (COG or MPO) planners in Texas, our students have also gone on to practice globally. Our graduates work with some of the top planning, engineering, and design firms in the country, such as Jacobs, AECOM, Stantec, Asakura Robinson, and others. They have also been employed at Uber, Google, and Amazon. Recent graduates can be found in the following positions:
 
FORT HUACHUCA, Ariz., -- More than a century after Guglielmo Marconi helped pioneer trans-Atlantic communications, High Frequency (HF) has continued to be a consistent, economical and reliable long-range communications platform; being of practical use in natural disasters, as well as, for military applications.
 
The critical importance of modern HF communications can perhaps be best exemplified by the wireless Marconi distress call CQD meaning, "All stations distress" and the newly adopted SOS signals transmitted by the R.M.S. Titanic on the night of 14 April, and morning of 15 April, 1912 after the ship struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic.
 
While the communication events surrounding the Titanic disaster helped generate interest in HF radio governance and radio-relay station expansion, the use of HF after World War II slowly became a dying art with the invention of satellite, tropospheric scatter, Line-of-Sight (LOS) microwave and fiber optic technologies.
 
According to English, both civilian and military communications networks benefit from HF technologies as the radio platform is used in a myriad of situations from natural disasters to military command and control. For instance, on the civilian side, HF communications is heavily used by amateur radio operators for voice, as well as, a plethora of digital communication protocols.
 
On the federal side, agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) use HF for over the ocean communications for air traffic control, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) uses HF radar to measure ocean currents on both the east and west coasts.
 
HF has become a critical PACE platform during natural disasters, extensively used during a number of natural disasters, to include the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Nepal earthquake in 2015, and the recent 2018 earthquake in Puerto Rico. HF communication nets are activated throughout the June-November hurricane season to track and report hurricane conditions in and around affected areas, as was done most recently during hurricanes Henri and Ida.
 
With a global demand for HF applications, along with a military and civilian necessity to exercise communications connectivity during crisis and critical military operations, services are recognizing the need to get personnel trained and proficient in using HF communications. NETCOM is actively working with mission partners to meet training requests.
 
In the spring of 2019, NETCOM designed technical HF assistance labs at Fort Huachuca, Arizona as a proof-of-concept. By summer, the command was running more than a dozen labs with units from around the globe; participants hailed from Europe, Alaska, Hawaii and all-around the Continental United States.
 
Long range, infrastructure free voice and digital communications are the primary applications used in the labs. Unit personnel must have a basic understanding of HF communications and how to operate the Harris HF radio.
 
Through these HF training labs, NETCOM strives to give students a holistic and thoughtful problem-solving skillset that allows them to find solutions to long-range communications challenges, said English.
