You have your international superhits (think The Beatles, Pink Floyd, AC/DC), then you have the more obscure rockers, independent, local or regional (like Check out After the Sky and Paris in The Making). Canopus Distro goes above and beyond with their extensive collection of the best of both worlds. As a bonus for gig enthusiasts, the store looks and feels like a merch stand at a show. Cop some band merch and a couple of vinyls if you find yourself at this Jalan Sultan stalwart. **#04-16 Textile Centre, 200 Jalan Sultan**

 
This may be one place that strikes a chord with many on a more emotional level. If you've been one of those who came here to browse or pick out records when growing up, your life unfolding to the soundtracks of The Beatles, Michael Jackson, Norah Jones and Bob Marley, you'll know what the whole vinyl experience is truly about, with each tick and pop as the track fades being filled with memories and emotions your subconscious can't disassociate with. **#01-39 Burlington Square, 175 Bencoolen St.**

The first step to a vinyl collection is acquiring a decent record player. Retrophonic Records has all that you need to kickstart your vinyl addiction, including equipment. While the music collection is more mixed than it is curated, this Chinatown record store is your one-stop-shop to spinning your life away. **53A Duxton Rd.**
 

No matter your views, there is no denying that Mandopop is a titan in the local music scene. Sift through the racks here and you might just discover a Mandopop gold mine, with classics from the likes of Teresa Teng, Tsai Chin, Fei Yu QIng and Wang Jie to add to your collection. **Bedok Shopping Complex, 292 Bedok Rd.**
 
Nestled in the lanes of Joo Chiat, Retrocrates is the ideal place for music-lovers to relax, unwind, and crate-dig in a leisurely manner for all genres of music, old and new. The independent record store offers a range of turntables as well as a large library of new and pre-loved vinyl records for sale. The second-floor shop house, complete with sofas, cushions, and rugs, allows for customers get comfortable and immerse themselves in the music.
 
The walls of Slow Boat Singapore are lined with shelves of vinyl records put up on display, from indie bands such as **Vampire Weekend**to classics like **Michael Jackson**.
 
Tickets for Slow Boat in Singapore are priced at **S$30** for an hour of listening, and you get **one free drink** of your choice to boot! If you ask me, I think this is super worth it because where else can you get to listen to vinyl records with a provided player and immerse yourself in the retro music aesthetic?
 
In the age of vinyl, this wasn't much of an issue, as albums usually contained liner notes listing key contributors. That tradition carried over to the CD era, with informative inserts and booklets being the order of the day.

Cue the Recording Academy (the folks who hand out Grammy Awards), which worked with TBWA\Chiat\Day Los Angeles to launch "Behind the Record," an initiative urging artists to credit those who help their music soar.
 
Performers can upload "Credit Covers," recognizing contributors on their albums and singles, to the special website. (The Black Keys, Alicia Keys, Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift and other A-listers have already done so.) They're asked to share the covers across social media and tag those working on their projects, using #GiveCredit #WeAreMusic #BehindTheRecord.
 
"The Recording Academy came to us with the idea of doing some sort of 'Credit Day,'" TBWA\C\D group creative director Jason Karley tells Muse. "'Behind the Record' felt like the perfect name for an initiative that is all about bringing those amazing creators behind our favorite records to the forefront, which quite literally brought us to the idea of the Credit Covers."
 
"We wanted something that was inherently social, but that could also literally replace the original album cover with a new one," he says. "The design was a challenge, as we had to be able to scale from a relatively small number of collaborators up to almost 100 for some albums, and still look creatively consistent."
 
To ensure accurate sourcing of who did what across various songs and albums, the Academy is teaming with metadata specialist Jaxsta, which collects credit information from labels, publishers, royalty agencies and industry associations.
 
"I think artists have always instinctually sought to give credit to their collaborators," Karley says. "That's why almost every Grammys acceptance speech thanks producers or writers or engineers in name or in general."
 
Fancy a cup of coffee to go with an afternoon session of crate digging? You'll feel right at home in **Choice Cuts Goods + Coffee** **Blaccsmith** **HQ**, where you can dig through a hefty selection of records ranging from hip-hop to soul, R&B to afrobeat and anything else in-between. Choice Cuts occasionally holds parties, like their recent Dilla celebration, so it's an incredibly lively place anytime you step foot into its quarters.
 
**Simply Music**is a shop renowned for their jazz and classical selections along with pricey Japanese pressings of various titles. You can also grab quality but affordable turntables there like the Audio-Technica LP120 if you want to start out right!
 
Hawking almost exclusively Pro-Ject turntables, you can worm your way up the audiophile ladder beginning with the Debut Carbon model. And of course, they have records too; a fine selection of new titles along with a wide range of second-hand titles, mostly in very good condition.
 
A relatively new store in the building, the husband-and-wife duo behind **Mosta Records LP** have briskly made their mark by securing record shipments directly from reputed labels like Jack White's Third Man Records, Light In The Attic, Waxwork Records, Fat Possum Records, Jump Up Records, Mondo Records and Death Waltz Records. Step in and you'll find yourself digging for hours, with an abundance of records across a wide spectrum of genres, but we especially recommend their reggae and soundtrack sections.
 
Enter **For the Record** and you'll find a room, top to bottom, stuffed with records from different decades. It can be daunting digging in this room, especially if you're new, but all you have to do is to ask owner Giri or his brother Sree to help you find a title and they'll oblige without fuss.
 
Giri is a man of humor and fine music; ask him for some recommendations if you're up for it and he'll be able to find you some records to fit your taste. His collection ranges mainly from the 50s all the way to the 90s, spanning from Frank Sinatra to Discharge to Bach, so don't expect to find Arctic Monkeys here. What you'll find instead is a shop you'll want to keep coming back to.
 
Their name suggests a gathering of friends, and you'd be right to assume the best out of this shop. With a generous array of used records, mostly from Japan, you'll get a kick out of **Vinyl Kakis** if you're especially into music from the 70s and 80s. Definitely worth a few hours of intense digging, or if you'd just like to congregate with like-minded music lovers.
 
Keeping Music Alive is their tagline, fully believable with their vibrant catalogue of new, reissued and used vinyl. Located in the area of Joo Chiat, **RetroCrates** bucks the trend of a central location so eastside music lovers with an afternoon to kill and money to spare would do well in this lovely store.
 
It's not rare to find many record stores organising musical performances, meet-and-greets, and the occasional guest DJ on board, wax heads and passers-by alike flocking into stores to catch a glimpse of all the action. Artists and bands are also known to drop a list of exclusive releases just for RSD, so the most fervent of fans ought to pay their local record stores a visit in order to get their hands on one of the usually limited copies.

This year, the first drop for RSD is set to take place on **12 June 2021 (Saturday),**a day before restrictions from current measures are set to be lifted.
 
While celebrations in Singapore may continue to take on a more muted approach given the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) restrictions, the spirit of RSD remains alive and strong amongst record stores and music-lovers alike. We spoke to some participating stores in Singapore to find out what they had planned, and included a few other listings that you should check out. Read on to find out more - Ready, Sanitise, Crate-dig!
 
Mosta Records is a vinyl record store that also became an indie artist management label in 2017. They're authorised dealers of **Third Man Records** (owned by legendary rockstar **Jack White**), Audio-Technica turntables, **Fat Possum Records** and several more. We spoke with head honcho **Mr Azri Ali**to find out what Mosta Records has up its sleeves this RSD.
 
Too many to list down, but definitely **Ibrahim Maalouf**'s S3NS. He's one of our favourite artists. All our staff who've worked here loved that record. We got the album directly from the management of the artist, which was really special. We have his whole catalogue. The artistry of the French-Lebanese jazz trumpeter, composer and conductor is just mesmerizing. A must-listen and buy.
 
PS: Mosta Records will also upload a special DJ set by **MC Jahi** from the legendary hip-hop group **Public Enemy**. He is doing it exclusively for Mosta Records to celebrate RSD and the release of his record 'Forward Future', which will be available in-store too!
 
Vinyl Kakis, run by Cherilyn Tan since December 2016, is a record store that largely stocks used vinyl from 'uncommonly common' genres such as retro pop, metal, experimental and more. It hopes to spread the love of these lesser-known styles of music to its customer kakis (Bahasa Melayu for 'friends'). We s
