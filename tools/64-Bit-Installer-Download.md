The first time around, I thought it was just an installation error on my part, so I went through the entire process of re downloading the installer and setting it up all over again. Now I have 'Dropbox Installer', 'Dropbox Installer 1', and 'Dropbox Installer 2' all lined up on my desktop. My assumption is that the installers can be deleted after a successful installation of the app.
 
The problem is, I cannot eject any of the installers because I keep getting the message that the Finder is still using it (even though I am not aware of this being the case). I went through the whole "go to the activity monitor and force quit the app" process. Every other forum page gives explanations on how to uninstall the app, which is not what I want either. I just want to get rid of the three dropbox installers on my desktop

I've got a VI that I've built into an executable - everything up to that step works fine. I want to make an installer to package it with labview runtime to use on other computers, and can successfully build the installer, but when I try to run it I get the error while the installer is initializing:
 
I'm running LabVIEW 64 bit version 2022 Q3 22.3f0, under "additional installers" I've tried leaving it on "Automatically select recommended installers" and manually selecting things with no impact. I've tried building with "minimize media prompts while building your installers, copy the selected installers and all future installers to this computer. This application requires you to copy installers as administrator" both checked and unchecked. I've tried running the installer as administrator (and labview when building). Nothing has made a difference.
 
This issue was reported to NI yesterday and we are investigating. One of our older packages for older installer support on the build system is confused by the newer version of .NET 4.8. Our current understanding is that if you can upgrade the version of ni-mdfsupport package to version 22.8 or later, the problem will be mitigated. You should be able to do this fairly easily in NIPM using the Updates tab when viewing hidden (infrastructure) packages when connected to ni.com feeds.
 
Torsten, you are correct that when using the Download button on ni.com for the NIPM product, you can only download the latest (23.3) version of the online installer for NIPM. That is because NIPM's feed on ni.com contains all versions of NIPM packages, and an online installer will always install the latest version of packages in registered feeds. The only way to install a specific version of NIPM is to download the offline installer for that version.
 
Part of the reason that this issue occurred is because the NIPM installers do not include updates to a set of components (i.e. ni-mdfsupport) that installer builders, like LabVIEW, use to create installers using our older "meta deployment framework (mdf)" technology. A newer version of LabVIEW would include them. The instructions that I shared previously should work, and we will likely create a KB soon that will include an offline installer that contains the updated set of packages to fix this issue.

However I can't find the update for the ni-mdfsupport package using NIPM. I'm using "the Updates tab when viewing hidden (infrastructure) packages when connected to ni.com feeds." like mentioned, but see nothing.
 
There is no way to reasonably roll back the NI Package Manager to implement the suggested fix. I just tried all the versions back to 21.8.0 and only 23.3.0 didn't try to remove all of the dependent programs IE labview and test stand and all. Please make the NI-mdfSupport package available on the latest version of NIPM. When can we expect this to be fixed?
 
We have an installer that we will likely add to a new KB, but I would prefer to not post the installer until we have an official KB, hopefully next week. If you would like to test the installer, you can send me an email directly or send a private message using the forums and I will send you a temporary link to it.  
  
I have sent the installer to all above that have commented.
 
Hi, I'm assuming you're running Windows and your installer isn't working... Have you installed Dropbox before by any chance?? I had this problem when I tried uninstalling dropbox, my computer crashed, and then I was unable to reinstall Dropbox.

Did you figure out how to fix it? Just did the same thing and have been trying to fix it for much longer than I should need to. I have tried Dropbox support but they tell me to do what I have done before and failed with
 
OMG! This worked for me too! I had to change Dropbox to a different drive folder, and it would no longer sync and would fail when re-installed. Saved me so much time, as I've been trying to fix this for about 2 weeks now. Now, it'll take 2 days to complete and download all my files. Thanks again
