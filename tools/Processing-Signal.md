According to Alan V. Oppenheim and Ronald W. Schafer, the principles of signal processing can be found in the classical numerical analysis techniques of the 17th century. They further state that the digital refinement of these techniques can be found in the digital control systems of the 1940s and 1950s.[3]
 
In 1948, Claude Shannon wrote the influential paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" which was published in the *Bell System Technical Journal*.[4] The paper laid the groundwork for later development of information communication systems and the processing of signals for transmission.[5]
 
Analog signal processing is for signals that have not been digitized, as in most 20th-century radio, telephone, and television systems. This involves linear electronic circuits as well as nonlinear ones. The former are, for instance, passive filters, active filters, additive mixers, integrators, and delay lines. Nonlinear circuits include compandors, multipliers (frequency mixers, voltage-controlled amplifiers), voltage-controlled filters, voltage-controlled oscillators, and phase-locked loops.

The methods of signal processing include time domain, frequency domain, and complex frequency domain. This technology mainly discusses the modeling of a linear time-invariant continuous system, integral of the system's zero-state response, setting up system function and the continuous time filtering of deterministic signals
 
*Analog discrete-time signal processing* is a technology based on electronic devices such as sample and hold circuits, analog time-division multiplexers, analog delay lines and analog feedback shift registers. This technology was a predecessor of digital signal processing (see below), and is still used in advanced processing of gigahertz signals.
 
The concept of discrete-time signal processing also refers to a theoretical discipline that establishes a mathematical basis for digital signal processing, without taking quantization error into consideration.
 
Digital signal processing is the processing of digitized discrete-time sampled signals. Processing is done by general-purpose computers or by digital circuits such as ASICs, field-programmable gate arrays or specialized digital signal processors (DSP chips). Typical arithmetical operations include fixed-point and floating-point, real-valued and complex-valued, multiplication and addition. Other typical operations supported by the hardware are circular buffers and lookup tables. Examples of algorithms are the fast Fourier transform (FFT), finite impulse response (FIR) filter, Infinite impulse response (IIR) filter, and adaptive filters such as the Wiener and Kalman filters.
 
Nonlinear signal processing involves the analysis and processing of signals produced from nonlinear systems and can be in the time, frequency, or spatiotemporal domains.[7][8] Nonlinear systems can produce highly complex behaviors including bifurcations, chaos, harmonics, and subharmonics which cannot be produced or analyzed using linear methods.
 
Polynomial signal processing is a type of non-linear signal processing, where polynomial systems may be interpreted as conceptually straightforward extensions of linear systems to the non-linear case.[9]
 
**Statistical signal processing** is an approach which treats signals as stochastic processes, utilizing their statistical properties to perform signal processing tasks.[10] Statistical techniques are widely used in signal processing applications. For example, one can model the probability distribution of noise incurred when photographing an image, and construct techniques based on this model to reduce the noise in the resulting image.
 
Signal processing involves converting or transforming data in a way that allows us to see things in it that are not possible via direct observation. Signal processing allows engineers and scientists to analyze, optimize, and correct signals, including scientific data, audio streams, images, and video.
 
Companies spend millions of dollars every year buying test equipment so that their engineers and technicians can record test data. This investment in equipment and manpower to conduct tests is for one purpose: to understand how their products will work in the real world. This understanding can only come from capturing and analyzing high-quality, objective data.
 
**Signal processing**(aka digital signal processing), takes several forms depending on the application. In the data acquisition (DAQ) world, we use signal processing in order to analyze measured data.
 
Historically, signal processing was performed entirely in the analog domain. For example, signal filters were built using discrete components like resistors, capacitors, and inductors. This is still done, of course, but since the late 20th century, data of all types have become increasingly digitized. As a result, signal processing has necessarily transitioned from the analog to the digital domain.
 
Today, digital signal processing is done primarily in software. Signal processing software can run on the processor or graphics card of a desktop computer, or in a smart device. For more demanding applications it runs on dedicated DSPs (Digital Signal Processors), ASICs (Applications Specific Integrated Circuits), or FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), and on powerful computer mainframes.
 
Today, the power of even notebook computers is far greater than the biggest mainframes from the past, and a huge array of signal processing functions can be performed both in real-time and post-processing by PC-based DAQ systems.
 
Many systems employ a combination of host computer processing and DSP processing to perform signal processing functions. DSP hardware is very fast and can be dedicated to common functions. For example, DSPs are used in analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for filtering, combining digital bit streams, and more. They can handle a lot of data very quickly.
 
Signal processing operates on both linear and nonlinear systems, however, most systems fall into the nonlinear camp, i.e., those whose values change over time, often in unpredictable ways, where a change in output is not linearly proportional to a change in the input.
 
**Spatio-temporal**domain, i.e., across both space and time. For example, monitoring the routes of hundreds of aircraft all around the world, or thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth
 
Filters are also defined by how many poles they have. The more poles, the steeper the roll-off they are capable of performing on the signal. This roll-off or slope simply means how many decibels of the signal can be rolled off per octave. The specification of the filter in question will typically give the maximum roll-off in dB/Q.
 
No filter is perfect. They can impose phase delays, ripple, ringing, and other distortions within the passband. The trick is to choose the correct filter prototype that works best for the type of signals being processed. You will hear of filter prototypes such as Bessel, Butterworth, Elliptic, and Chebyshev, to name a few. Over the years, engineers have developed numerous filtering prototypes in order to provide the best possible results for various applications:
 
In applications that require a simple, unchanging filter in the analog domain, it can be cheaper and easier to use an analog filter design. However, if it is required to have filters that are adaptable to a variety of applications, or to run in the digital domain, the digital approach is far less expensive and occupies a lot less space. Digital filtering can also be more accurate since it eliminates the tolerances of discrete components in the analog domain (resistors, capacitors, etc).
 
**FIR (finite impulse response)**filters are calculated with many coefficients and are well-known for having essentially zero phase shifts within the passband. This is critical when signals will be compared on the time axis. FIR filtering is very calculation-intensive.
 
**IIR (infinite impulse response)**filters are calculated with far fewer coefficients than FIR filters, so they are less processing intensive. They are a direct equivalent to the classic analog filters. For example, with IIR filters we can achieve the exact theoretical low pass, high pass, sound weighting, and other standard filters found in analog circuits.
 
The blue curve is calculated with an FIR filter. Note that there is zero phase shift. In many applications, it is very important that the signals are not delayed by the filters, since phase comparisons are being made. In these applications, FIR filters are very important.
 
Converting a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain allows us to see things in it that are not possible via direct observation. In the complex AC waveform shown below, the signal is composed of numerous frequencies:
 
When you strike a structure with an impact (impulse) hammer, you excite a broad range of frequencies within the structure. Impulse hammers have an accelerometer built into them so that we know the exact force that has been applied.
 
Signal processing is applied across many industries and sectors, including acoustics, modal testing of structures, video processing, geophysics, automotive engineering, aerospace engineering, energy, medical imaging, RADAR, SONAR, LIDAR, and more. Each one applies
