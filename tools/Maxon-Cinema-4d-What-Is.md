And it's definitely not Maxon taking over your computer. It's a fully functional version licensed for use with After Effects. It's well documented in the user manual, including instructions on how to remove it if you'd like to do so (of course, you're limiting what AE can do if you uninstall it).

You cannot assume that your users will consult an Adobe user manual on this if programs with no recognizable relation to Adobe appear among the newly installed programs - and not every Adobe Cloud customer primarily uses After Effects, relevant here, and is already informed about the context.
 
Personally I think it is well established within the software industry to include a warning on installation about 3rd party software and give users an opt in/out during installation. At least, that's what reputable firms do.
 
I also find it highly odd that organisations with a near monopoly in software need to have unpaid users who are not employed by said firm to provide support on their software and yet defend their actions with a somewhat militant perspective rather than said firm aknowledging and dealing with the cause for complaint.

Your response handily evades the question of whether this is potentially adding a backdoor for the users computer to be pooled into a server farm. Is it, or is it not allowing my machine to be pooled hardware without my explicit consent to do so?
 
Seeing as Microsoft see it fit to make my machine part of a distribution network for their software updates, it seems entirely possible that Adobe may be trying to do the same thing, and given the legal and financial implications of the installation of 3rd party software the lack of notification could give rise to serious legal issues.
 
As the managing director of my organisation I dont have time to read the user manual for every piece of software that I use, and I find a condescending response to people effectively saying that they are incompetent because of having real security and performance concerns is not helpful and honestly why are you bothering other than to feather your own ego?
 
Nope not when I have never used the software or know IF I'm even going to use it. Last thing I need is an application from Adobe installing undisclosed software that is not Adobe's. If you read the user manuals for sofware you are not using then you have more time than I. Congrats.
 
For what it's worth, junior IT staff working in video and audio post would be expected to know how to configure After Effects, including the 3D integration. Specific settings might be on-the-job learning, but certainly not what's what.
 
So I'll take that as a no. 
For what it's worth its standard practice in an IT department to install "unknown" software for testing and evaluation in a test enviroment. Again, just never have thought I have to treat Adobe as "unknown".
 
Let's head off another surprise here: After Effects, Cinema 4D, Premiere Pro, Media Encoder, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Animate, etc do not run well on virtual machines. They need to be tested on real hardware. The common practice in broadcast is to thoroughly test a workststion (or any candidates for use as a workstation) before rolling out updates and/or new software. The same goes for academic lab environments.
 
and did you install a product you don't use??, really if you're a motion graphic designer you will thank adobe for this integration and the ability to use the C4D files inside AE, and as Warren says, you can simply uninstall the C4D light if you don't need it. finally, if you want you can ask adobe to make installing the C4d light optional, post your idea here
 
Right on, Warren. You provided excellent service and tried your best to explain basic concepts and procedures to extremely ignorant individuals that can't seem to grasp the simplest of ideas. It was painful reading through the thread, but it was very helpful nonetheless. Thank you for your time and dedication.
 
It's probably a frustrating thread because of a choice by yourselves very early on to criticise people for installing software before reading the whole user manual cover to cover as if we are being handed out this great tool by the kind hearted charity of the saint of adobes goodwill and we're too much of a bunch of feckless dossers to appreciate it.
 
Martin was absolutely right in saying we shouldn't be expected to read the entire user manual for every piece of software before installation, which is absurd, I was right in saying it is standard practice to include a warning in the installer, and yes it is a legitimate legal/security concern because various legislations might force companies in certain sectors to vet maxon prior to installation.
 
So all in all, your repeated assertions that we are somhow morons for not gleefully lapping up your schtick and comparing us to the office intern in an attempt to belittle people just underlines why I am going to f&ck adobe right off and go to some of their competitors who likely can afford to actually pay for some genial customer support staff and whose manuals I will probably choose not to read, as is my perogative.
 
Blender and Cinema 4D are pretty tough competitors and have two very different target audiences when it comes to features in accessibility to these 3D programs. So how do you know which one you should be using and what are the big ticket features you need to know about each, such as rendering, modeling, community, and a lot more!
 
**Blender is definitely harder to learn than Cinema 4D**. If you are a more technically minded person, you may find yourself having a lot of fun with the node system and playing around with scripting in Blender. Cinema 4D is very well known for being pretty easy for beginners to pick up. I remember my first few tutorials and how easy it was to make something really cool with just one video. That is what inspired the way I teach Blender today.
 
**In recent years, Blender has drastically improved the user interface**. It went from being this clunky mess to a very well oiled machine that does a really good job of keeping your viewport from getting overly cluttered. It can definitely improve, but 3D programs have to juggle 1000 things
 
I would say Cinema 4D lacks in this area. Windows can take up more space than I think that they should, but you can find a good workflow with that. Overall I think Blender has a user interface that is much more approachable for a beginner, and Cinema 4D has one relatively streamlined for someone with a specific workflow.
 
**The community for plug-ins in Blender is almost never ending**. Because Blender is open source, people can just go in with an idea, turn that into a product, and sell it. More often than not, those plug-ins are free. On top of that, the paid plug-ins are generally more cost effective compared to Cinema 4D. If I'm being honest, I would prefer higher prices for some of these solo Blender add-on developers so that they can make a full-time living and continue making even better tools. Regardless of my opinion, if you like really cool fun plug-ins the Blender community will not disappoint .
 
While Cinema 4D plug-ins can be expensive, they are very very impressive and there are a lot of really cool developers out there. Both communities will not disappoint you on plug-ins but the Blender community will keep some money in your bank account.
 
**Cinema 4D is king when it comes to motion graphics**. I can say flat out, if your goal is to make industry standard motion graphics, you are going to want to use Cinema 4D. The cinema MoGraph System is simply superior. Blender can do most of what Cinema 4D can, it will just take you longer to pull off.
 
**Modeling in Blender is very straightforward and pretty easy to get your mind around**. The latest updates have created some pretty simplified controls for geometry manipulation and poly modeling. At this point, creating things such as hard surface robots and home interiors is a very clean, intuitive process. And if you add in some of the very popular plug-ins, it will make it even easier.
 
**Both programs have a very sprawling tutorial community on YouTube**. But I have to say for my own experience blender definitely has far more content and a more active community. Both communities are incredibly active and are full of incredible artists and people who love to learn the program. But I personally had a better time learning Blender on YouTube then when I was learning Cinema 4D on YouTube. And there is a plethora of professional paid courses, on the Blender side they are generally going to be much less expensive than Cinema 4D courses.
 
Most people will choose based on their current financial situation. Blender is free and it certainly will not limit you with the type of work you want to create. At times it may be more difficult than Cinema 4D, but there are dozens of movies and shows that use Blender in their pipeline. If you have the cash, I would say Cinema 4D currently is a better product!
 
Cinema does a much better job at making difficult tasks easier to do...especially When it comes to motion graphics and other tasks that need to be automated. However, with a dedicated development team and a robust community, it won't be long before Blender comes even with Cinema 4D.
