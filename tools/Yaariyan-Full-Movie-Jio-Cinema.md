Director duo Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru made a romantic saga amid a war in Russia with Salman Khan and Sneha Ullal back in 2005 (Lucky- No Time For Love). For all its flaws, it was ambitiously crafted and exquisitely shot and had a haunting soundtrack acting as its spine. Sanam Teri Kasam (2016) gave all the dejected lovers enough material to create reels on social media. What does Yaariyan 2 give? Maybe designer lehengas, stylish outfits, and one rehashed song from the earlier film.
 
In the days when we are celebrating the return of Hindi cinema with blistering successes like Jawan, Pathaan, and Gadar 2, and surprises like Zara Hatke Zara Bachke and The Kerala Story, a film like Yaariyan 2 is likely to create that room of lull all over again. It is not as unwatchable as it is unnecessary and barely does anything for the leads. Unless you count the 25 million views on its trailer on YouTube the hallmark of success.

**YAARIYAN 2** is the story of three cousins. Laadli Chibber (**Divya Khosla Kumar**) lives in Shimla with her mother (Lillete Dubey). She was suffering from thalassemia but has now recovered. Laadli wanted to fall in love and then get married. Her mother, however, asks her to meet Abhay Singh Katyal (Yash Das Gupta). Both click and they decide to get married. Laadli immediately calls Shikhar (**Meezaan Jafri**) and Bajrang Das Khatri aka Bajju (**Pearl V Puri**), her cousins who are closest to her, for her wedding. After marriage, Laadli moves to Mumbai with Abhay. Bajju, too, works in Mumbai. Shikhar is forced to shift to Mumbai and work as a delivery boy after he faces a roadblock in his biking career. Laadli faces trouble in marriage as Abhay seems indifferent to her. Shikhar changes his SIM card and gets hounded with calls from Ikroor (Anaswara Rajan). He meets her and both fall in love. Bajju, meanwhile, begins a relationship with Shona (Warina Hussain). Shikhar, however, has reservations about Shona and her behaviour. This causes a rift between the trio. What happens next forms the rest of the film.
 
YAARIYAN 2 is based on BANGALORE DAYS [2014] and the story is promising. We have seen films about siblings and friends. A film about cousins is rare. Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's screenplay flows well and is replete with some nice dramatic and emotional sequences. Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's dialogues are youthful and modern. However, the dialogue about nappies is repeated far too many times.
 
Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's direction is creative. The director duo is known for adding a lot even to their ordinary shots. This trademark stamp is visible from start to finish. While they handle all tracks well, the track of the dead girl's parents is very moving. The race sequence, meanwhile, is gripping.
 
On the flipside, there's hardly any comedy. For a film about friendship, there should have been more humour. The character of Bajji gets a raw deal in the second half as he is hardly there. Moreover, at 150 minutes, the film is too lengthy.
 
Speaking of performances, Divya Khosla Kumar looks charming and performs the difficult role with ease. Meezaan Jafri shows a marked improvement compared to his work in HUNGAMA 2 [2021]. Pearl V Puri is decent but could have been better. Yash Das Gupta emerges as the best performer in the film. Warina Hussain looks stunning but could have done better in some difficult scenes. Bhagyashri Borse (Raajlaxmi) looks stunning and leaves a mark. Anaswara Rajan is lovely but goes over the top in emotional scenes. Priya Prakash Warrier is wasted. Murli Sharma is dependable. Lillete Dubey hams.

The songs are decent though it's in no way close to the hit soundtrack of YAARIYAN [2014]. 'Saure Ghar' is the best followed by 'Simroon Tera Naam', 'Oonchi Oonchi Deewarein', 'Suit Patiala', 'Heer Bhi Roye', 'Peene De' and 'Bewafaa Tu'. 'Sunny Sunny 2.0' and 'Blue Hai Paani Paani' are just okay. JAM8's background score is functional.
 
C R Ravi Yadav's cinematography is stunning. Mumbai has never been captured like this before. Shankar Samanta's production design is rich. Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru's costumes are glamorous, especially the ones worn by Raajlaxmi. Allan Amin's action is fine. Abhishek Kumar Singh's editing is weak. The film should have been shorter by 15-20 minutes.
