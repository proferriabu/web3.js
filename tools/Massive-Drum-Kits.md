**Drums of St Paul** was recorded in the massive sanctuary hall at historic Saint Paul's in San Francisco, CA (the same location as our renowned Requiem Light Symphonic Choir). This powerful multi-sampled drum library captures a variety of kick, snare, and tom articulations from three different microphone positions for a crisp and lush natural reverb and open tone you can blend effortlessly to create an epic sound for any genre. The kick comes with high and low bass drum strikes, metal, rim, and side clicks. The snare was sampled with snares on and off, rimshots, and rim clicks, while the tom includes high and low strikes and rim clicks. We prioritized maximum clarity and presence for each instrument with a wide stereo image, up to 13 velocity layers and 16 round robin.
 
The Kontakt interface includes a suite of automation-ready sound-shaping controls to give you total creative flexibility. You have control over swell, attack, release, offset, vibrato, filter, pitch (coarse & fine), articulation switching, cross-fading and layering, and so much more.
 
This library is designed for the full retail version of Native Instruments Kontakt 6.2.2 or later. Kontakt is an industry-standard advanced virtual instrument software platform. You can view screenshots of this library's custom graphical user interface in the image gallery above. This library is packed with features to provide you a wide range of sound shaping parameter controls, each one totally automation-ready in your host environment or Kontakt's stand-alone mode. Learn more about Kontakt by **Clicking Here**.
 
This is a standard Kontakt open-format library, so the free Kontakt Player **does not** fully support it and can only run it in a limited "demo mode". However, the sample directories are unlocked so you can use them in other wav-compatible software, sampler and synth formats. The special Libraries tab doesn't support this open-format Kontakt library, but you can use the standard File browser tab and import this library into the Kontakt Quickload window for easy loading and navigation.
 
The full retail version of Native Instruments Kontakt version 6.2.2 (or later) is required to use .nki instrument presets included in this library. The free Kontakt "Player" and "Add Library" import process do not support this standard open-format Kontakt library. Windows 7 or higher. Mac OSX 10.12 or higher. Dual Core CPU, 2 GB System Ram, SATA or SSD hard drive recommended for this library.

For over a decade, our mission has been to create an ever-growing selection of inspiring instruments, orchestral sections, drums, percussion ensembles, choirs, solo voices, folk and vintage instruments, experimental sonic contraptions, cinematic effects and sound-designed creations.
 
This kit features 4 custom drum kits hand-selected by F.O.N. members C.P. Dubb, Joey Knocks, Ron Sizzle & J-Holt. It features crisp and hard-hitting industry-standard drums that can be heard on some of your favorite records.
 
The kits shown in the library browser are less than the presets of each of the drum instruments and I'm not sure if some of the library content is shared between drum instruments. However, just browsing through the list of kits in DMD, makes me second guess why I bother to create my own kits from my sample library, when I've barely tried the 170 kits already included? In fact, I'm sure I've created an 808 and 707 kit from free samples I downloaded, that might not be as good as the delivered DMD 808 and 707! Crazy!
 
But... can the 100 Ultrabeat kits be used outside of Ultrabeat? I don't see them in the library browser at all? I realize Ultrabeat is older but I presume there are still Logic users that like those kits and kit pieces. Is there a way to export Ultrabeat kits to DMD?
 
But, but... also, Is there a way to open more than the 20 acoustic kits in Drum Kit Designer, like the 170 "Electric Kits" for DMD? When Apple added the Producer + kits (30) it looked like Drum Kit Designer was offering more kits, but in fact, many were just augmenting the original 20. So, in my case, I tend to only ever use the Producer + kits and skip the original 20. I finding it tough to understand the future of Drum Kit Designer, now that DMD exists.
 
But... I don't use the library browser much, as I prefer to select presets and saved kits from inside the instrument. I've been confused why the 170 DMD kits are under the heading "Electronic Kits" when these kits are not 'synth drums' but sampled drums. The heading makes me think those kits are synthesized electronic drums, when really they could be anything, depending on the samples used - many of them acoustic samples. Rant done.
 
Just like you can't generally load a patch for Sculpture into RetroSynth, an Ultrabeat voice consists of a drum-specific synthesis engine, and/or a sample. That voice (or collection of voices in a kit), needs the Ultrabeat engine to play it.
 
Similar as above - Drum Kit Designer is a multi-sampled, round-robin acoustic drum playback instrument (it's Sampler under the hood). You can add Samplers to DMD (I think by default it uses Quick Sampler for sample playback, and Quick Sampler doesn't have all the multisampling and round-robin stuff of the full sampler).
 
They are quite different. One is an interface on deep sampled drum kits, the other is a way to quickly put together beat kits of simple samples. You wouldn't use DMD generally to create highly detailed acoustic drum kit parts with multiple round-robins etc, you'd do that in Sampler - DMD doesn't offer anything here.
 
Stuff has to be grouped somehow, you might have chosen a different scheme, but Apple did what they did and they usually make some kind of sense. If you want to organise the content differently for your own reasons, you are free to do that...
 
I still need a little clarity on this.... I count 110 Ultrabeat Kits by folder in /Library/Application Support/Logic/ Ultrabeat Samples/ Each folder has anywhere from 25 - 100 \*.aif files that make up the kit. We're talking roughly 3600 kit piece samples. But, I don't see those kit names or sample files in the main Library... even when Ultrabeat is the track instrument.
 
If I wanted to create a DMD kit using the samples of an Ultrabeat kit, I could drag the 25 - 100 kit pieces for a given Ultrabeat kit into a blank DMD. I realize, I'd be missing all the Ultrabeat synth config - I would just have the raw samples. Has Apple/Logic ever provided a more direct approach to converting an Ultrabeat kit to DMD?
 
So, if you have, say "Sampler" focused, Logic shows you all the Sampler Instruments for it. With Alchemy focused, it will show you Alchemy patches. With Ultrabeat selected, it will show you Ultrabeat kits - these are all the formats that the plugin saves.
 
You'll notice that if you focus on Sampler, what \*doesn't\* happen is the Library browser shows you, along with all the sampler instruments, \*any audio file on your computer\* just because you could load those into an instance of Sampler. This would be confusing, and wouldn't work anyway, as an audio file doesn't contain the state of the Sampler instance. Same with Alchemy, Ultrabeat and so on.
 
In short, the Library browser isn't intended to replace a file browser when you want to import content into a plugin, it's to show you the saved settings of that plugin. It's for saving/loading finished sounds, not for helping you \*create\* new sounds or any assets a plugin can import.
 
Now in Ultrabeat, when you go to import an Ultrabeat sound, that browser (when you click on Logic in Ultrabeat will show your Ultrabeat sounds, samples and so on, just like Alchemy, Sampler etc when you add audio files, as loading samples is a different thing to saving the plugin state as a finished preset.
 
I'm trying to convert or open an Ultrabeat kit in DMD. The only method I've found that will work, is to play every note, piece, then bounce the audio, and drag the resulting audio file to create a new DMD kit and rely on the transient detection to separate all the pieces, then label each part and save the DMD as a new kit.
 
Thanks - I'm embarrassed. 20 years of using Logic and I never notices that little blue arrow on the channel strip. I guess when you open a plugin, the blue arrow defaults to 'Settings'. This is one of those simple things I should have learned 20 years ago, but quite frankly, I don't use the Library browser very much, and select presets from the plugin drop down menu's itself. [that sounds like an excuse for being dumb!]
 
In there you'll see folders like, eg "Ultrabeat Samples", "Sampler Instruments", "Samples" and so on - it should be fairly straightforward to explore. Also you have Channel Strip Settings/Instrument/04 Drums & Percussion/03 Ultrabeat Drum Kits/ and Plugin Settings/Ultrabeat/ so on.
