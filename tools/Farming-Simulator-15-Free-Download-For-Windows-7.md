In career mode, players take on the roles of farmers. Their tasks depend on expanding and upgrading dated equipment and machinery, which can be achieved by harvesting and selling crops. Players are free to explore the surrounding areas of the map, grow from their choice of several crops, and invest their money in additional fields and equipment. They can also raise livestock or earn an income from forestry.
 
There are dynamically generated missions that consist of the player performing various tasks within a time frame such as mowing grass, fertilizing fields, or delivering cargo. The player is rewarded with money once the task is finished, plus a bonus based on how quickly the task was completed (excluding *Farming Simulator 19,22*).
 
*Farming Simulator 2009* is the second game in the series. It had a lot of new features such as new crop types (corn, rapeseed/canola, and barley), modding support and much more machinery, while having the same map as 2008, but remastered.
 
This is the third game in the series, and first to feature a multiplayer mode. It was greatly expanded with the introduction of a new map. Machinery from Deutz-Fahr, Pttinger, and Horsch were added (also featured in the *FS 2009* Gold edition). Cows were also an addition to this title.
 
The initial release for *Farming Simulator 2013* was on October 26, 2012.[2] A version was released for the PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in 2013, known as *Farming Simulator*.[4] Almost a year after its PC release, it received a large update and re-release under the title *Farming Simulator 2013 Titanium Edition*, on October 10, 2013.

For the first time in the base game, soybeans, sunflowers, and oilseed radishes are introduced as growable crops. In previous games, the player would have had to download a modification to add these crops. The crop growing mechanics have been altered, to allow different ways to increase crop yield. These include fertilizing the fields multiple times throughout the growth stages, plowing the field after a set amount of harvests, de-weeding crops, or using oilseed radish as a cover crop.[10] The missions system were also updated, allowing the player to do work for other in-game farmers. Other additions include drivable trains and an in-game radio. On November 14, 2017, a new expansion pack was released for all platforms.

*Farming Simulator 14* was released for iOS, Android, Nintendo 3DS, Windows Phone and PlayStation Vita on November 18, 2013,[18] and gives a more polished and more casual gaming experience on mobile platforms than its predecessors.[19] There are 10-20 brands in the game.

GIANTS Software established an Esports league in 2019. There exist about a dozen teams, many who are sponsored by farming equipment companies. Instead of running a farm like the objective in the game series, the competitions are a 3v3 match to obtain the highest score of hay bales dropped off within a given time limit.[24]
 
Reception of the Farming Simulator series has been mixed across all titles, with critics praising its sense of relaxation and array of realistic machinery and vehicles.[25] Some have criticised the games for their repetition and lack of interesting mechanics, while others argue such qualities should be expected in a simulator. Though the series targets the audience that are knowledgeable in the farming industry, the series is generally liked by both farmers and non-farmers alike.
