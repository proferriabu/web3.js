But, if you can find a list of all the problematic passages in the 1970 NAB OT and compare them to the 2011, more than 90% of the time, you will find that the 2011 fixes the problem. Example: Psalm 23.
 
The NABRE changes are quite welcome and have improved the translation, but in many areas the revisers were content to leave the text as it stood. The notes remain the same in some areas as well. These are not bad things. I think they started with a very good rendering and improved it.
 
Excellent article, informative. Where exactly have they mentioned these details about the upcoming edition? I also wished that the name should be simplified to NAB by removing RE. I will have to postpone my plan to buy this until this latest edition arrives. The page design is the best and unique, but the study notes are the most scholarly in which they explain the WHY of every crucial thing with critical scholarship, whereas all the other study Bibles moves in circle with a dogmatic doctrinal approach without any literary and source criticism.

My request would be for them to render text translations literally rather than interpretatively, such as Gen 3:15 and 12:7 seed should be singular for the typological allusions to Christ. Rendering them plural hinders the typological quotation allusion. I have not read it but gender inclusive nonsense should be avoided by all cost. And the homosexuality verse should not be narrowed down to boy prostitution.
 
This is because there are fewer translations that contain the full canon of Scripture (including the deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament), and the number of such bibles that include study tools is smaller. This is unsurprising; the large selection of Protestant study bibles reflects the number and diversity of Protestant beliefs.
 
That said, there exists a spectrum of Catholic study bibles created by the scriptural translations and study tools. Although their differences present nothing like the range of options found in Protestantism, they can be important nonetheless. Let me share some thoughts on the most readily available Catholic study bibles on the market today.
 
If you wish to have the best traditional, orthodox study notes, the Ignatius Catholic Study Bible is hard to beat. The Didache Bible is a close second. Both feature the top-notch RSV translation and their notes are generally faithful to Church tradition.
 
One additional resource that should not be overlooked is the Navarre Bible, which was inspired by the founder of Opus Dei, St. Josemaria Escriva. Its faithful and extensive notes utilize official Church documents, the early Fathers and Doctors of the Church, as well as contemporary Catholic theologians and Church documents. Although a highly-respected and sought-after resource, it is difficult to count the Navarre as a study Bible, however, for it is published more like a commentary set. Only the New Testament can be purchased as a single volume, while the Old Testament books constitute a seven-volume set.
