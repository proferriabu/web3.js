The CP210x Manufacturing DLL and Runtime DLL have been updated and must be used with v 6.0 and later of the CP210x Windows VCP Driver. Application Note Software downloads affected are AN144SW.zip, AN205SW.zip and AN223SW.zip. If you are using a 5.x driver and need support you can download Legacy OS Software.
 
Virtual COM port (VCP) drivers cause the USB device to appear as an additional COM port available to the PC. Application software can access the USB device in the This page contains the VCP drivers currently available for FTDI devices.
 
Virtual COM port (VCP) drivers cause the USB device to appear as an additional COM port available to the PC. Application software can access the USB device in the same way as it would access a standard COM port.
 
If a custom vendor ID and/or product ID or description string are used, it is the responsibility of the product manufacturer to maintain any changes and subsequent WHCK re-certification as a result of making these changes.

A driver is a software component that lets the operating system and a device communicate. For example, when an app needs to read data from a device, it calls a function implemented by the operating system. The operating system then calls a function implemented by the driver. The driver, usually developed by the device's manufacturer, knows how to communicate with the device hardware to get the data. Once the driver gets the data, it gives it back to the operating system, which then gives it back to the app.
 
Drivers don't always have to be developed by the device's manufacturer. If a device follows a published hardware standard, Microsoft can write the driver, so the device designer doesn't have to provide one.
 
Not all drivers communicate directly with a device. Often, several drivers layered in a driver stack take part in an I/O request. The conventional way to visualize the stack is with the first participant at the top and the last participant at the bottom, as shown in this diagram. Some drivers in the stack change the request from one format to another. These drivers don't communicate directly with the device. Instead, they change the request and pass it to drivers that are lower in the stack.
 
Some filter drivers observe and record information about I/O requests but don't actively take part in them. For example, some filter drivers act as verifiers to make sure the other drivers in the stack handle the I/O request correctly.
 
For example, if you need to write a tool that accesses core operating system data structures, you can split the tool into two components. The first component runs in user mode and presents the user interface. The second component runs in kernel mode and accesses the core operating system data. The component that runs in user mode is called an application, and the component that runs in kernel mode is called a software driver. A software driver isn't associated with a hardware device.
 
Software drivers always run in kernel mode. They're primarily written to access protected data only available in kernel mode. However, not all device drivers need access to kernel-mode data and resources, so some device drivers run in user mode.
 
Our explanation so far oversimplifies the definition of function driver. We stated that the function driver for a device is the one driver in the stack that communicates directly with the device. This is true for a device that connects directly to the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus. The function driver for a PCI device obtains addresses that are mapped to port and memory resources on the device. The function driver communicates directly with the device by writing to those addresses.
