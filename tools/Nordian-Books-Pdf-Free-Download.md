Nordian was initially established by the Norwegian Government in 1989 as a National Flight Academy and later as the National Institute of Civil Aviation, a recognised carrier of Norwegian aviation expertise.
 
Nordian AS is a well-established Norwegian provider of training material and e-learning solutions to Airlines, Aviation Training Organizations (ATOs) and Military Training Organizations around the world. Nordian training material and systems are used for Traditional Training (tuitions in class), Blended Learning (tuitions in class and programmed Self Study) and Distance Learning.
 
Nordian was initially a Norwegian Government funded Aviation Training Organization established in 1989 which trained pilots for direct entry to SAS on behalf of Royal Norwegian Air Force. 
The company now specializes in development of high-quality ground training material and distance learning courses.
 
The course content is available from the LMS platform. After login, the student will find detailed Study Instructions which tells the students what to study with reference to the books or CBT/animations, and where to find Self-Assessment tests, Progress tests and School exams. The 15 e-books are available as a complimentary resource.

Combined, the 15 books contain more than 3500 full colorillustrations. The Nordian JAA ATPL Manual series is based on theJAR-FCL Learning Objectives, and the material is arranged systematicallyto produce a progressive program of instruction which can be usedeither for self-study or in a classroom environment. Studentself-assessment tests are included in most chapters, and a practicalJAR-FCL code index which shows in which chapter you will find anyspecific topic.
 
The Question-bank is built with intuitive user interface. Thestudents get an immediate feedback right/wrong. When a test iscompleted, the student is presented with test results along withspecific JAR FCL codes for failed questions.
 
The entire set of 15 books cover the learning objectives of the EASA helicopter syllabi for PPL, IR, CPL, ATPL/IR and ATPL courses. An invaluable asset in exam preparation and gaining knowledge. Packed with a total of over 2200 illustrations and a large number of questions, the books are authored by experts in the respective subjects and extensive teaching experience.
 
Aviation books and multimedia can serve you as a learning aid or just to relax and improve your knowledge of aviation history. Here you will also find books that can help you make your next flight safer, like books about meteorology or navigation.
 
Or choose from a variety of CDs and DVDs with content for rookies as well as veterans. Thanks to those multimedia, you can learn new skills like handling some instruments. Those are not just some regular textbooks; those are comprehensive books for both student pilots and professionals.
 
I was working on a design for Nordian Book Tool mobile app developed as a support for Nordian books and manuals. The app allows access to all of the latest updates for the books, online Question bank, and related multimedia content and animations.
 
I've been working on designing and producing titles of all books in the helicopter series: layout systems and covers, illustrations, image editing, completing page revisions and text corrections, preparing production-ready book files, and overseeing production.
 
Main topics are among the following: Air Data Instruments and Radio Altimeters, Gyroscopes, Magnetic Compasses, Inertial Navigation Systems, IIS and EFIS, FMS, Engine Instrumentation, Helicopter Automatic Flight Controls, Alerting and Recording Systems, ACAS, TAWS.
 
Together with our books Airframes and Systems for Helicopters, Powerplant for Helicopters and Electrics, the Instrumentation for Helicopters book covers the curriculum in the Aircraft General Knowledge as required by EASA.
 
From the books contents: Masses, Centre of Gravity, Reference System, Helicopter Mass Check, Floor Loads, Calculation of Traffic Load, Mass & Balance calculation for a Single Engine Piston Helicopter, Mass & Balance calculation for a Twin Engine Turbine Helicopter.
 
Within the EASA countries SI units are supposed to be used. On the other hand, it is common to use US units in aviation. In this book SI units are used as first choice and US units when it seems logical to do so.
 
A hand-crafted list of books which we recommend a student studying for DGCA ATPL pilot exams should refer to. These books will be a lifetime collection and will be very helpful during command training in an airline.
 
The candidates are advised to refer to the relevant topics as per the prescribed syllabus in the CAR., covered in the above reference books for the particular category of pilot license examination, they desirous to appear for.
