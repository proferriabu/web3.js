It is way down in the lower-center part of the image. My point basically is that you aren't going to see those big beautiful pictures you see on NASA's website. So now search your brain, and think if this is what you want to do. If you aren't as interested, still stay, as you may not have to lose hope yet!
 
The biggest problem you hear in astronomy is that someone got a big 1000 dollar telescope and hated it and stuck it back in his/her closet. So this is probably the most important step. You will be donating a lot to this new hobby, and the time, money, and regret can cost you if you are not careful. I will get into this more in the choosing your first telescope section of this post.
 
Do not buy a telescope and fancy camera just so you can take pictures! I hear about this, and always think to myself that these people are losing all the fun that you have while stargazing because they're just trying to take the perfect shot! calm down, as you can get into astrophotography later if you like it.
 
This is something that worries a lot of people. They always think that if they don't get the best they will die.(I did this as well, but calmed down and got a cheaper telescope. It worked for me until I felt it was time to level up) But to tell you the truth, if you don't dig astronomy, then you will only have spent 800-1000 dollars of well-spent money on nothing. I included some great choices for beginners on which telescope to get:

Now many people want to get a computerized scope, and I find those scopes great AS long as the are not EQ mounts, our equatorial mounts, as these are harder to deal with. I would also not recommend Reflector Telescopes, as these are hard to manage. I would also not recommend Cassegrain Telescopes, as these are hard to manage. Trust me.
 
--since you may not know enough about the constellations, make sure you have something to see what is out with. Celestron's SkyPortal app for Ipad and Iphone is a great place to start, as it is easy to use and free.
 
I recently purchased a Skywatcher Skyliner 200P (8" Dob) and was wondering which are the best books available for learning how to effectively navigate the sky and learn of new and interesting objects I wouldn't have come across before?
 
I had "Stargazing For Beginners" by Anton Vamplew and Will Gater purchased for me recently. It's decent enough at setting out the basics but I want something in more detail. I've also requested "Turn Left At Orion" as a Christmas present, which I know is highly recommended by plenty of people. What can folks recommend which would be a nice/useful compliment to those two books?
 
One point is many books tend to assume a fair degree of knowledge so although many back away from it go get a childs book, sort of 5-8 years. Thinking along of constellation identification, a simple low level book for that is useful. I have adult level sky guides and working out which stars make up a constellation is near impossible in the plates suppiled. Believe me The Janet and John book of constellations is a lot better.
 
Nightwatch by Terence Dickinson is the gold standard. You can then move on to his more advanced The Backyard Astonomer's Guide co-authored with Alan Dyer. These books are very well written and comprehensive.
 
I would recommend the "Nortons Star Atlas and Reference Handbook", look for the latest edition. This atlas / handbook has been around since the 1930s and has been refined over the years, the reading is easy, and there is a wealth of information to help you observe, and all in a single volume.
 
Hello, Turn left from Orion can't go wrong and everyone should have a copy, as you have a dob if you do have Telrad fitted the finder charts by Brent Watson are very good and will keep you busy for a long time!!!
 
TLAO, is to say the least....................an astronomer's "bible". It should be in everyone's collection. I have said in the past that it is a bit over-rated, but for people just starting out and wanting to learn how to star hop................its absolutely about the best.
 
Personally one book i hold in very high regard (its the 1st book i bought), is "Astronomy" by Ian Ridpath. I like it because it starts out on a basic level (the history of Astronomy) and as you progress through the book it gets more advanced (Astrophysics............but still on a basic level).
 
Most if not ALL astronomy books do and will say the same thing and the star charts are all the same. They really are only reference books at the end of the day. As a person new to Astronomy and wanting to learn your way around in easy steps......................I think TLAO is the one that will teach you this.
 
I have to agree that Turn Left at Orion is worth having. It helped me to get going with star-hopping and gives reasonably accurate renditions of what you can expect to see at the eyepiece of various sized instruments from binoculars to medium-sized dobs. And it doesn't just deal with the more obvious brighter objects. I used it the first time I explored the Coma/Virgo galaxy region and I expect I'll turn to it again this spring. For some reason it is just a lot more straightforward than some other guides. Perhaps its the big pages printed right to the edge that really helps in the field.
 
Some might argue it isn't for beginners, but I'd say that if you are going to find your way around the sky he does a great job of explaining the star-hopping process and at the same time manages to cover a lot of ground (ending with some very useful material for a Messier Marathon). Its the sort of book where you can devote a night to each constellation doing a thorough exploration.
 
There are three main types of beginner telescopes: Reflector, refractor and catadioptric, all of which are best suited to viewing different celestial objects. Typically, reflectors are better for viewing faint, deep-sky objects like nebulae and galaxies, whereas refractors are popular for observing objects like planets or moons. Catadioptric telescopes give you the best of both worlds and can be a happy middle ground.
 
Reflectors use a primary mirror to capture light from the telescope tube, then a secondary mirror to reflect the light into the eyepiece. These types of telescopes are often less expensive to build since they require the creation of a single large mirror instead of the multiple glass elements you'd find in refractors.
 
In this guide, the least expensive beginner telescope we've reviewed is the Encalife SVBONY 501P 70, which is available for around $89.99 at the time of writing. However, it should be noted that while we gave it three out of five stars, it's not the best at anything in particular and we'd only recommend it for lunar viewing. If you'd prefer something budget-friendly that can do a little more, then take a look at the Celestron AstroMaster 102AZ telescope.
 
The Unistellar eQuinox 2 telescope tops our list of the best beginner telescopes. It's a smart telescope that automatically orients itself and can image straight from the Unistellar app on your smart device. However, it may be out of budget for many.
 
If that's the case for you, then take a look at the Celestron Inspire 100AZ, which we'd recommend for astrophotography (you will need a camera and an adapter though). Discover what equipment do you need to see and photograph the planets with our handy guide.
 
The Celestron Inspire 80AZ is the best beginner telescope for kids because it offers more than most beginner packages and it's easy to assemble. Want to browse the very best models? We have an entire buying guide dedicated to the best telescopes for kids.
 
The Celestron Inspire 100AZ has a phone mount that ships with the telescope as well as other accessories you'll need to get started. But increasingly there are many models that ship with phone mounts. Either to hold while you use one of the best stargazing apps, to manually guide you while you navigate the stars, and some phones use apps that control the telescope electronically. Take a look at the models above to decide which you want or need.
 
We've chosen the telescopes on this list based on their user-friendliness, ease of setup, and quality optics. We've also included telescopes at a range of different price points, so no matter your budget we've got something to suit.
 
Our list has been put together with the help of our expert reviewers, and you'll find links to full reviews on many of the telescopes mentioned below. We've included lots of information on each model featured, including its specifications, who the telescope will suit, and reasons why you should or shouldn't buy it.
 
If you're already a more experienced stargazer and you're looking to upgrade, we also have guides to the best telescopes overall and best telescopes for deep space. If you're on a tight budget, take a look at our guide to the best telescopes under $500 for some more affordable options. If your children are showing an interest in astronomy, you may want to explore our list of the best telescopes for kids, and those who want to try their hand at astrophotography should consult our guides to the best cameras for astrophotography and best lenses for astrophotography.
 
During our Unistellar eQuinox 2 review we were particularly impressed with the Smart Light Pollution Reduction feature, which makes the telescope more usable in densely populated areas by digitally removing city glow from the images of the night sky. This feature makes this telescope particularly appealing to astrophotographers.
