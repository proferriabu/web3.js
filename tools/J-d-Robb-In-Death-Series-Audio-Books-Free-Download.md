With a phenomenal career full of bestsellers, Nora Roberts was ready for a new writing challenge. As her agent put it, like Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and caffeine-free Pepsi, a pseudonym offered her the opportunity to reach a new and different group of readers. The first futuristic suspense J. D. Robb book, Naked in Death, was published in paperback in 1995, and readers were immediately drawn to Eve Dallas, a tough cop with a dark past, and her even more mysterious love interest, Roarke.

I hate to leave a negative review but, these are not MP3s, which I can live with. However, while I've only burned the first 10 of them to MP3s, there is a recurring problem. At least half of them are incomplete. For example, if Audible shows it as 12 hours, on the dvd it turns out to be five or six hours. Just finished listening to Seduction in Death and wow, the last chapter is missing. Really? We need better quality control here.
 
This series was discontinued due to issues with the two authors as well as the publishing house. You can't buy the first 4-5 books in the series in print, ebook, or audiobook. An old print copy for one of them can go for like $200 on ebay. So to find the entire audiobook series for such an insanely good price made me take the plunge and buy. I figured even if it didn't work, it was worth the attempt. But the CD came, had everything on it, and I've since converted it to listen to the Books app on my iPhone. Soooooo worth it.
 
Couldn't believe the great price for this series. CD came in good time, even during the holidays. The audio is slightly lower quality than expected, but once you get into the groove of listening you stop noticing.
 
A rare and hard to find series of audiobooks. And a fantastic find in this case. The sound quality varies, but considering the source material, not too bad at all.
Prompt and efficient delivery (to UK).
Certainly good value for money.
 
OH.EM. GEE!!! This has got to be the longest series I have ever had the privilege of creating a reading order guide for. And WOW does it look good. Recommended over and over again by fellow book enthusiasts, I was delighted to find out that J.D. Robb is Nora Roberts (I love her books!).
 
I kept hearing over and over again how Roarke was one of THE most AMAZING book heroes ever, and so I finally decided to look these up. I could read to my hearts content and indulge in a world for weeks with this one! Massive amounts of 5-star reviews with almost every book!
 
I came across the in death series by accident and only have the last three to read. I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts and she has never disappointed with these or her other books. I cant wait for her to keep adding to it. Very rare can an author have so a long running series and continue to keep you in touch with all of the characters.
 
It is my understanding that Mel Gibson has bought the movie rights to some of these novels, but as to when we can expect the movies, that is up in the air. Maybe Me. Roberts can give us an insight as to when this is to happen. I have loved her TV movies in Lifetime on some of her N R novels. Thanks for providing the list it is really appreciated.
 
Aerobics, your daughter is still too young for these books. There is too much sex in them for her to read. I recommend finding her some more age appropriate reading and have a good talk with the stepmom.
 
Personal comments.
I like stories and TV series with strong women. So Eve Dallas and Anita Blake among others (A.B sometimes boring with the complicated sex scenes but i like her)
TV-serials like Against the Wall/Missing(2012)/Being Erica/ Tru Calling/ In Plain Sight/Unforgettable(wrong choices in men!? whatever)/Fairly Legal/Crossing Jordan show that the people that make the decisions are more interested in brothel series(bachelor/ millionaire/farmer) and i miss out.Still can review them!!
 
I LOVE!!!!! the In Death series. A friend gave me a few books and I loved them. I got a nook and have been able to start at the beginning and have now read 39 of her books. I just finished Concealed in Death. I am anxiously awaiting hew next books.
 
Love the In Death books . What does one read while waiting for the next new book . Any suggestions? Roarke is strong dangerous yet gentle while Eve his perfect match is a kick ass no BS woman. I could learn a lot from her
 
You can read it out of order but I would suggest finding the first one because that tells you how Roark and Eve first met. I first read a couple of the books that A friend gave me then I got enough and was able to read the rest of them in order which I recommend
 
I discovered the Eve Dallas books in May of 2015. It took me till Nov 2015 to read them all. It felt like I lost a close friend. I was lucky to acquire the recordings of 40 of the books. I listen while working or cooking. I look forward to the future additions.
 
I would love to see Eve and Roarke have a child/children. Especially a multiple birth where I can imagine all sorts of hilarious and loving situations happening. Is this likely to happen or does that not suit her character?
 
I am now reading this series for the 2nd time! First started in June of 2006 and read all that were available at that time. Then I parked the books in my bookcase, meanwhile buying any new ones that came out. Now, in 2019 I am reading every book again! So far am on book #18 and enjoying every one just as much as I did the first time around! Love this series!
 
I love the in death series. Eve Dallas is the soul of every woman & Roarke is the perfect picture of the dream prince lover. I love the new couples. Keep writing this wonderful script & I ll keep reading.

I love the in Death series. My supervisor got me hooked and I started with audio and then I bought the books and audiobooks to. First cassettes now mp3 and I have at least 10 friends hooked also mostly audio.
Try them you may love them. PS my daughter loves them and listens to them over and over. They are a family affair.
 
Laura, thanks for sharing. I have been a long-time fan of the In-Death series. I am the proud owner of the paperback edition of Naked In Death that came out way back when. I have the entire series and the MP3 Discs of every book, that I listen to in the car. I hope the series never ends.
 
I agree about the money thing. I figured Robb thought it would be too jarring to try to use hugely inflated currency amounts ($100K boots?) so stuff like that is pretty current. Then again, the world went thru the Urban Wars so maybe that reset worldwide currency values.
 
I did want to add that many of the books do have a high gore/violence level, often of a sexual nature. Sometimes children are involved. One of the books I finished recently was particularly disturbing to me. So be forewarned.
 
Is there a list somewhere of the more gory entries in the series so I can avoid? The podcast episode about the academic writing about series themes also intrigued me about the series but I am more of a cozy-type mystery person.
 
I love these books. After 45 of them there are some I love more than others, but these books hold up really well. About 2 years ago I did an entire series reread and it reminded me why I love them so much.
 
I admire those of you who can do an entire series reread. Robb/Roberts has some verbal ticks that drive me crazy if I try to read too many of her books in a row, so I always have to space them out a bit and read others in between.
 
I highly recommend reading the series in order, both to keep the characters straight and to watch the development of the relationships and personalities (and because I have book series OCD and must read books in order). When a new character comes in as a minor part, I wonder if/when I will see them again and how they will affect future books (like Peabody).
 
This series is one of the great loves of my life. I can happily wax about it for hours and hours. In addition to Eve and Roarke, the supporting characters are just gold. Especially Peabody. I worship Delia Peabody. She is amazing.
 
One thing that amazed me about how she handled Eve and Roarke is that she has avoided the tedious breakup-to-provide-interest. They have conflicts, but they work through them, all the more amazing in such a long series.
 
I love Eve & Roarke, yes. I adore Eve & Peabody almost as much. But what brings me back over and over is how the secondary characters have grown and developed, both in character and quantity, over the series. It really is something special.
 
I love the series. I like how competent Eve and her friends are and how all the bonds are forming in time. True the Eve Rork love was pretty quick consumed but the book
