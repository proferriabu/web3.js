A **nova** (pl. **novae** or **novas**) is a transient astronomical event that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently "new" star (hence the name "nova", Latin for "new") that slowly fades over weeks or months. All observed novae involve white dwarfs in close binary systems, but causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars. The main sub-classes of novae are classical novae, recurrent novae (RNe), and dwarf novae. They are all considered to be cataclysmic variable stars.

Classical nova eruptions are the most common type. This type is usually created in a close binary star system consisting of a white dwarf and either a main sequence, subgiant, or red giant star. If the orbital period of the system is a few days or less, the white dwarf is close enough to its companion star to draw accreted matter onto its surface, creating a dense but shallow atmosphere. This atmosphere, mostly consisting of hydrogen, is heated by the hot white dwarf and eventually reaches a critical temperature, causing ignition of rapid runaway fusion. The sudden increase in energy expels the atmosphere into interstellar space, creating the envelope seen as visible light during the nova event. In past centuries such an event was thought to be a new star. A few novae produce short-lived nova remnants, lasting for perhaps several centuries.
 
A recurrent nova involves the same processes as a classical nova, except that the nova event repeats in cycles of a few decades or less as the companion star again feeds the dense atmosphere of the white dwarf after each ignition, as in the star T Coronae Borealis.
 
Under certain conditions, mass accretion can eventually trigger runaway fusion that destroys the white dwarf rather than merely expelling its atmosphere. In this case, the event is usually classified as a Type Ia supernova.
 
During the sixteenth century, astronomer Tycho Brahe observed the supernova SN 1572 in the constellation Cassiopeia. He described it in his book *De nova stella* (Latin for "concerning the new star"), giving rise to the adoption of the name *nova*. In this work he argued that a nearby object should be seen to move relative to the fixed stars, and thus the nova had to be very far away. Although SN 1572 was later found to be a supernova and not a nova, the terms were considered interchangeable until the 1930s.[2] After this, novae were called *classical novae* to distinguish them from supernovae, as their causes and energies were thought to be different, based solely on the observational evidence.
 
If the accretion rate is just right, hydrogen fusion may occur in a stable manner on the surface of the white dwarf, giving rise to a supersoft X-ray source, but for most binary system parameters, the hydrogen burning is thermally unstable and rapidly converts a large amount of the hydrogen into other, heavier chemical elements in a runaway reaction,[2] liberating an enormous amount of energy. This blows the remaining gases away from the surface of the white dwarf and produces an extremely bright outburst of light.

The rise to peak brightness may be very rapid, or gradual; after the peak, the brightness declines steadily.[4] The time taken for a nova to decay by 2 or 3 magnitudes from maximum optical brightness is used for grouping novae into speed classes. Fast novae typically will take less than 25 days to decay by 2 magnitudes, while slow novae will take more than 80 days.[5]
 
Potentially, a white dwarf can generate multiple novae over time as additional hydrogen continues to accrete onto its surface from its companion star. Where this repeated flaring is observed, the object is called a recurrent nova. An example is RS Ophiuchi, which is known to have flared seven times (in 1898, 1933, 1958, 1967, 1985, 2006, and 2021). Eventually, the white dwarf can explode as a Type Ia supernova if it approaches the Chandrasekhar limit.
 
Occasionally, novae are bright enough and close enough to Earth to be conspicuous to the unaided eye. The brightest recent example was Nova Cygni 1975. This nova appeared on 29 August 1975, in the constellation Cygnus about 5 degrees north of Deneb, and reached magnitude 2.0 (nearly as bright as Deneb). The most recent were V1280 Scorpii, which reached magnitude 3.7 on 17 February 2007, and Nova Delphini 2013. Nova Centauri 2013 was discovered 2 December 2013 and so far is the brightest nova of this millennium, reaching magnitude 3.3.
 
A helium nova (undergoing a helium flash) is a proposed category of nova event that lacks hydrogen lines in its spectrum. The absence of hydrogen lines may be caused by the explosion of a helium shell on a white dwarf. The theory was first proposed in 1989, and the first candidate helium nova to be observed was V445 Puppis, in 2000.[8] Since then, four other novae have been proposed as helium novae.[9]
 
Astronomers have estimated that the Milky Way experiences roughly 25 to 75 novae per year.[10] The number of novae actually observed in the Milky Way each year is much lower, about 10,[11] probably because distant novae are obscured by gas and dust absorption.[11] As of 2019, 407 probable novae had been recorded in the Milky Way.[11] In the Andromeda Galaxy, roughly 25 novae brighter than about 20th magnitude are discovered each year, and smaller numbers are seen in other nearby galaxies.[12]
 
Observed recurrent novae such as RS Ophiuchi (those with periods on the order of decades) are rare. Astronomers theorize, however, that most, if not all, novae recur, albeit on time scales ranging from 1,000 to 100,000 years.[15] The recurrence interval for a nova is less dependent on the accretion rate of the white dwarf than on its mass; with their powerful gravity, massive white dwarfs require less accretion to fuel an eruption than lower-mass ones.[2] Consequently, the interval is shorter for high-mass white dwarfs.[2]
 
A **recurrent nova** (**RNe**) is an object that has been seen to experience repeated nova eruptions. The recurrent nova typically brightens by about 9 magnitudes, whereas a classic nova may brighten by more than 12 magnitudes.[22]
 
Several extragalactic recurrent novae have been observed in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and the Large Magellanic Cloud. One of these extragalactic novae, M31N 2008-12a, erupts as frequently as once every 12 months.
 
On 20 April 2016, the *Sky & Telescope* website reported a sustained brightening of T Coronae Borealis from magnitude 10.5 to about 9.2 starting in February 2015. A similar event had been reported in 1938, followed by another outburst in 1946.[24] By June 2018, the star had dimmed slightly but still remained at an unusually high level of activity. In March or April 2023, it dimmed to magnitude 12.3.[25] A similar dimming occurred in the year before the 1945 outburst, indicating that it will likely erupt between March and September 2024.[26]
 
Novae are relatively common in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31); several dozen novae (brighter than apparent magnitude +20) are discovered in M31 each year.[12] The Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT) has tracked novae in M31, M33, and M81.[32]
 
With team members based on three continents, NOVA by Saint-Gobain helps to unlock innovation potential around the world, working collaboratively with startups as a strategic partner to connect them with the resources, support and expertise they need to succeed.
 
Nova is the OpenStack project that provides a way to provision computeinstances (aka virtual servers). Nova supports creating virtual machines,baremetal servers (through the use of ironic), and has limited support forsystem containers. Nova runs as a set of daemons on top of existing Linuxservers to provide that service.
 
All end user (and some administrative) features of nova are exposed via a RESTAPI, which can be used to build more complicated logic or automation withnova. This can be consumed directly, or via various SDKs. The followingresources will help you get started with consuming the API directly.
 
There is information you might want to consider before doing your deployment,especially if it is going to be a larger deployment. For smaller deploymentsthe defaults from the install guide will be sufficient.
 
**Compute Driver Features Supported**: While the majority of nova deployments uselibvirt/kvm, you can use nova with other compute drivers. Nova attempts toprovide a unified feature set across these, however, not all features areimplemented on all backends, and not all features are equally well tested.
