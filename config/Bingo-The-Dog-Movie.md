You should plan for what to do in case several people win on the same call,e.g. by having enough prizes for several winners, a prize that can be shared, or by giving the prize to the player who responded with "bingo" first.

Find and customize one of the millions of ready-made bingo cards, or use the simple bingo card generator to create your own. Then print as many cards as you need. You can even play virtual bingo using a computer, smartphone or tablet. It's fast and easy.
 
Enter the bingo title, select the size of your bingo card grid, and type your items into the squares. Whatever items you enter into the squares will be shuffled around when the bingo cards are generated.
 
**Tip:** You can put text and an image into a square. Use the text shadow to make the text "pop" against the background image. You can also change the vertical alignment of the text in the square so it does not cover the important parts of the image.
 
By default, when your cards are generated, the items are shuffled over the entire card. In traditional bingo, items are fixed to a certain column (and only shuffled within their respective column). To enable that, check the "Shuffle items only within their column" checkbox.
 
When you create your card, you can flip over a square to enter a clue/question. Whatever you enter on the back of your square will appear in the call list for your bingo game. For example, to help kids learn animal words, you might put the word "Bear" on the front of the square, and a picture of the bear on the back. When you play the game, the image of the bear will appear in the call list for your students to see. If they recognize the literal word "Bear" on their card, they would mark it.
 
After generating bingo cards or finding an existing bingo card, enter the number of cards you want to print, and select how many cards you want to print per page. You can print 1, 2 or 4 cards per page. Make sure you switch to landscape print mode on your printer to print 2 cards per page.
 
In the United States and Canada, **bingo** is a game of chance in which each player matches the numbers printed in different arrangements on cards. The game host (known as a *caller*) draws balls at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles. When a player finds that the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, they call out "Bingo!" to alert all participants to a winning card, which prompts the game host (or an associate assisting the host) to examine the card for verification of the win. Players compete against one another to be the first to have a winning arrangement for the prize or jackpot. After a winner is declared, the players clear their number cards of the tiles and the game host begins a new round of play.
 
Alternative methods of play try to increase participation by creating excitement. Since its invention in 1929, modern bingo has evolved into multiple variations, with each jurisdiction's gambling laws regulating how the game is played. There are also nearly unlimited patterns that may be specified for play. Some games require only one number to be matched, while cover-all games award the jackpot for covering an entire card. There are even games that award prizes to players for matching no numbers or achieving no pattern.
 
A game of chance named lotto was being played in Italy by about 1530. In the 18th century, a home version (called Tombola) was created in Naples with the addition of cards, tokens, and the calling out of numbers. In the nineteenth century, a game like this was widely played in Germany to teach children spelling, animal names, and multiplication tables.
 
The French game *Le Lotto* appeared in 1778, featuring 27 squares in a layout of three rows and nine columns. Five squares in each row had numbers ranging from 1 through 90, which led to the modern design.[1]
 
In the early 1920s, Hugh J. Ward created and standardized the game at carnivals in and around Pittsburgh and the Western Pennsylvania area. He copyrighted it and published a rule book in 1933.[2][3][*better source needed*]
 
The game was further popularized by Edwin Lowe. While at a traveling carnival near Atlanta in December 1929, the toy merchandiser saw people eagerly playing a game called "Beano", following Ward's rules, with dried beans, a rubber stamp, and cardboard sheets. Lowe took the game to New York, where friends liked playing it. The Lowe-produced bingo game had two versions: a 12-card set for $1.00 and a $2.00 set with 24 cards. By the 1940s, there were bingo games throughout the US.
 
The origin of the name *Bingo* is unknown but may date to the mid-1920s. There are claims that one of Lowe's friends[4] was so excited to have won that she yelled out "Bingo" instead of "Beano", or that the word echoes the sound of a bell.
 
The most common bingo cards are flat pieces of cardboard or disposable paper that contain 25 squares arranged in five vertical columns and five side-to-side rows. Each space in the grid contains a number, except the middle square, which is designated a "free" space.
 
A typical bingo game utilizes the numbers 1 through 75. The five columns of the card are labeled 'B', 'I', 'N', 'G', and 'O' from left to right. The center space is usually marked "free" or "free space", and is considered automatically filled. The range of printed numbers that can appear on the card is normally restricted by column, with the 'B' column only containing numbers between 1 and 15 inclusive, the 'I' column containing only 16 through 30, 'N' containing 31 through 45, 'G' containing 46 through 60, and 'O' containing 61 through 75.
 
In u-pick 'em bingo and other variants of bingo, players are issued three 25-number cards that contain all 75 numbers that may be drawn. Players then mark which numbers they wish to play and then daub those numbers according to the numbers drawn. In addition, double-action cards have two numbers in each square.
 
A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal. The most chips one can place on a bingo board without having a bingo is 20, not counting the free space. (For this to happen, two spots in opposite corners must not be filled along with a spot on one corner of the center away from the two opposite corner spots and finally opposite to that in relation to the center would be two flat against the center piece.)
 
In addition to a straight line, other patterns may be considered a valid bingo in special games. For example, a 22 square of marked squares in the upper-right-hand corner could be considered a "postage stamp". Another commonly valid pattern is covering the four corners. Certain special games only count specific patterns as bingos, such as a roving 'L', which requires players to cover all B's and the top or bottom row or all O's and the top or bottom row, or a blackout, covering all 24 numbers and the
