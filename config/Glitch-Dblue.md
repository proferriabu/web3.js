I know you can change the values of each glitch automation in the automation editor. You can try something there. Usually I get lazy and I have multiple tracks for multiple instances of dblue glitch. I fill the bar in with the Nothing value until I want the glitch to play (Like, half of it black, then red)
 
Sugarbytes also makes Turnado - it's a more hands on version of their other glitch style plugin Effectrix. I've been using Effectrix for a few months and like it. I have the Illformed Glitch plug in and find it is very cpu intensive and has a couple of annoying bugs. It occasionally hangs and crashes Logic. It took me a while to understand the workflow in Stutter and it was a bit confusing to set up but I finally got it going a couple of weeks ago and am finding it's really flexible - you can quickly customize your own glitch effect.

Okay so today I was cleaning up my mod folder and when I went into my game it had a hard time loading. It was stuck on the loading screen. I restarted my game and it finally loaded. After that, I went to click on a household and it's just a flashing blue box. **(picture down below.)** I can't play with the households either. The only thing I can do is create sims or build things, everything is perfectly fine in build mode. I tried creating a sim into a new household and when I was done it wouldn't load up and an error message popped up. **(picture down below.)**I also wanna mention that I bought an expansion and game pack the day the new update came out. I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the problem though! Even with taking my mods out of the game, it still had the same issue. I've been having problems with glitches since the update came out but this blue box thing just started yesterday.
 
Go to Documents/ElectronicArts - inside will be The Sims4 folder
Step 1. Rename The Sims4 folder to "The Sims4 old"
Step 2. Fix the game in Origin
Origin/Library - right-click on TS4 - option "Repair game"
You have to wait until Origin will fix all packs, not only the base game.
Step 3. Turn on the game - a new game folder will be created and you will have two - one old, one new
Step 4. Check if you still have this problem in the newly created game folder. Start a new game with a random sim and play for 10 minutes.
If the problem disappeared
Step 5. Delete in the new game folder following folders:
"saves" and Tray.
Step 6. Go to "The Sims 4 old" folder and copy - your "saves " folder.
Step. 7, Paste this folder in a newly created game folder.
Step 8. Do the same with Tray folder and TrayDeleteItems file
Step 9. If you don't use mods - skip this step.
Check if there are newly updated version mods you are using.
Then copy and paste your mods and CC from old mods folder to the new one. First copy the scripts mods every time checking if the game is working properly. If you have a lot of CC try 50/50 method ( divide your CC into smaller batches for example 50 pieces in one subfolder and check these subfolders one by one)
Step. 10. If all is OK - delete The Sims4 old folder. Now you will have only one game folder working properly.

I can confirm that this works, but I can't confirm how. Happened to both me and my brother on separate PSNs but on the same PS4. I think if you want to attempt this glitch your best bet is to earn all other trophies in Clash of the Clouds except **Blue Ribbon Champ**, then move on to finishing off all Burial at Sea related trophies (both episode 1 and 2) and just hope it pops. If it doesn't, unfortunately you will need to finish off the rest of the Blue Ribbons.
 
In case this glitch doesn't work for you or anyone else, it appears that the glitch from the PS3 version in which you can earn the same ribbon(s) multiple times also works in the PS4 version according to this post.

Can confirm the blue ribbon glitch works. Make sure to delete your profile save but DO NOT DELETE the auto save. Once you restart the game and earn blue ribbons the counter will recognize your progress from the auto save. You will receive an update every five medals (i.e. 45/60, 50/60).
 
Same here glitch worked for me, did all CitC trophies but Blue Ribbon Champion. Went and finished Burial at Sea Ep1 and then Ep2 in one play-through (1998 from the get go) and Blue Ribbon Champ popped after Taffer's Delight.
 
Attempted Burial at Sea - Episode 2 in one sitting but crashed rite near the end. I thought I was going to loose out on the trophy but even thou I had restarted the game, it popped along with completing the episode in 1998 mode.
 
Blue Ribbon Champ ended up popping immediately after my second-to-last trophy (which was Missile Defense System). It looks like it pops immediately after the second-to-last trophy you get in BioShock Infinite, regardless of what DLC you play last.
 
Blue ribbon unlocked when I unlocked Glutton for Punishment (which is actually super easy to farm in 1998 mode) Looks like they don't have to all be unlocked in one playthrough. I'm curious about alternating between dlcs, though.
 
thats werid it never happened to me on ps3. i just started on ps4 and did the clouds before anything else because i hate it the most. i ended up doing the other alternative of deleting the file and replaying the easy levels to add ribbons if anyone is wondering if that way works
 
It looks like those were the last two trophies you needed for the 100%. I just had Glutton for Punishment pop at the end of my Burial at Sea Episode 2 playthrough even though I hadn't quite gotten it yet (I was at 15 or 16 out of 20). It was the last trophy I needed for the 100% and was planning on cleaning it up right after.
 
I strongly suspect the game will just pop the last trophy you need after you earn the 2nd to last one regardless of what it is. Of course this is most useful with the Blue Ribbon Champ trophy, since that's the most annoying one.
 
So is it safe to say that it could glitch and auto-pop as the final trophy for the 100%? Other than Blue Ribbon Champ trophy, I still have three trophies (hard mode plus the two 1999-related) which will give me the plat. In theory, if I were to get the plat now, then Blue Ribbon Champ should pop as well? Anyone else did their playthrough with the plat being the "last trophy?"
 
Looking at the leaderboard on this site, there's just 16 people that lack one trophy in this game (14 need Blue Ribbon Champ and 2 need Taffer's Delight) and all 16 have the platinum as their last earned trophy.
 
Wish I knew about this when I platinumed/100% both version on my main! I will definitely be trying that out on this one (Which will act as my main). My name "vigors" comes from this game after all haha. I was lucky enough in my opinion to snag the PSN name "Vigors\_"
 
In my opinion, this is where the true magic of this glitch VST lies. Not only can you trigger specific effects, but you can alternate between effects. You can even combine effects together into specific sequences!
 
This means this glitch VST is perfect for live performances as well as the studio. It also features controls for each effect. You can dial in precisely the amount as well as custom parameters for each effect:
 
The most common use of this glitch VST is to create cool transitions. However, thanks to its great versatility, you can also use it to process sounds. You could for example create an echo layer to a vocal that is heavily processed and degraded.
 
What makes I Wish unique is the way you interact with it. Basically, you feed it audio, then play notes on your keyboard to pitch-freeze. This means you can instantly transform any sound source into a synth!
 
This is a fancy way of saying you can draw custom automation within the plugin. You can think of it as an advanced LFO module. Assign the envelope to any parameter you want within Stutter Edit 2, then draw a shape. This will instantly create moving effects.
 
Like with most glitch VST plugins, the buffer controls the size and repetition of the slices. Delay controls how fast those slices are played back. Finally, the Filter can be set to Low-Pass, High-Pass, Band-Pass, and Band-Reject.
 
The document describes the effects applied to an audio corridor using glitch and dub delay effects. The glitch effect made the audio sound very robotic and machine-like by repeatedly clicking the "both" button to find the desired sound. The dub delay effect changed the audio to have an echo-like, far away sound that repeats some words like a harmony. Both effects make the words difficult to understand clearly but the original meaning can still be recognized.Read less
