There are a plethora of different voice types used by vocal pedagogists today in a variety of voice classification systems. Most of these types, however, are sub-types that fall under seven different major voice categories that are for the most part acknowledged across all of the major voice classification systems.
 
If the singer were more comfortable singing higher, then the teacher would probably classify her as a soprano and if the singer were more
comfortable singing lower, then they would probably classify her as a mezzo-soprano. The teacher would also listen to the sound of the voice. Sopranos tend to have a lighter and less rich vocal sound than a mezzo-soprano. A voice teacher, however, would never classify a singer in more than one voice type, regardless of their range.

within these voice types may be able to sing somewhat higher or lower:
 
Expanding a male singing range can significantly enhance the versatility and expressiveness of a vocalist. It allows for the performance of a wider variety of songs and genres, and also opens up opportunities for solo performances, harmonizing, and vocal improvisation. Furthermore, a broader vocal range often leads to improved vocal control, tone quality, and overall vocal skill.
 
One of the key steps in increasing a male singing range is learning to bridge the gap between different vocal registers. This involves smoothly transitioning from chest voice to head voice without straining or breaking. Vocal exercises that focus on smooth transitions and vocal agility are essential for mastering this skill.
 
Regular vocal warm-ups and exercises are indispensable for expanding a male singing range. These exercises help in loosening up the vocal cords, improving flexibility, and gradually extending the range. Lip trills, sirening, and scales are examples of effective warm-ups that can aid in increasing vocal range.
 
Focusing on resonance and projection can also contribute to an expanded vocal range. By learning to amplify and project sound efficiently, male vocalists can achieve greater volume and clarity across their entire range. Working on resonance exercises and techniques can aid in achieving a more powerful and controlled voice.
 
Understanding proper vocal placement and support is crucial for increasing singing range. This involves learning how to position the voice to resonate optimally and utilizing the necessary muscle support for sustained and controlled singing. A vocal coach can provide guidance on refining vocal placement and support techniques.
 
Seeking guidance from a professional vocal coach is highly recommended for male vocalists looking to expand their singing range. A skilled coach can provide personalized feedback, targeted exercises, and valuable insights to help male vocalists navigate the process of increasing their vocal range effectively and safely.

The time taken to increase a male singing range varies from individual to individual. With consistent practice and proper vocal training, noticeable improvements can often be observed within a few months. However, significant expansion of the range may take years of dedicated practice and ongoing vocal development.
 
While certain foods and drinks can contribute to overall vocal health, there are no specific items guaranteed to increase a male singing range. Staying hydrated, consuming a balanced diet, and avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol can support vocal health, but the primary factors in vocal range expansion are proper training and vocal technique.
 
While a wide vocal range can certainly be advantageous for male vocalists, it is not the sole determinant of success. Vocal control, tone quality, emotional expression, and stage presence are equally important. A male vocalist can achieve success by honing their unique strengths and delivering compelling performances, regardless of the extent of their vocal range.

This vocal range typically spans from the E2 note to the E4 note, although some bass singers can sing even lower.

But anyways, my vocal range is : E2-B5 (a lot of low tenors have this range more or less, like Miljenko Mattijevik from Steelheart, quite a few of them can go even lower, like Rob Halford from Judas Priest)
 
I can't really tell where my "breaks" are, especially because now i'm doing things like stretching chest voice a little bit more, I never really experienced any Chest-Head breaks, or Chest-Mid breaks or cracks, maybe I learned how smoothly connect these registers over time, I used to sing a lot in Head voice with a lot of pharyngeal resonance trying to sing along to Axl Rose from Guns N'Roses, it didn't hurt, but, didnt sound good .
 
I have never had any true private singing lessons, I did try some voice programs though, (Per Bristow, Singing Success, but then I thought SLS just wasn't my thing, and I went for Ken Tamplin Vocal Academy's course How to sing better than anyone else, which suits me much better, because I'm a hard rock singer)
 
I think based on the fact that your mixed voice going up to D flat (Db5) above the tenor high C I think you are a Heldentenor with a bass range down to low E and a soprano quasi-falsetto up to soprano high B. Have you ever tried singing an operatic tenor high C?
 
In celebration of the Billboard Music Awards last week, Concert Hotels put together a little chart to show off the vocal ranges of a handful of the greatest singers in popular music and found the likes of Axl Rose and Mariah Carey sitting on top. They missed a few names though, naturally, and (even more naturally) the Internet was pissed, so VVN Music took it upon themselves to investigate further. Now Mike Patton tops the list with his massive, six-octave range.
 
Bruno MarsBruno Mars has a distinct light-lyric tenor voice that is soothing to hear. It ranges from C3 to D5 to C6, and he sings in a retro style that appeals to his fans. Mars also has a massive voice that distinguishes him as a tenor rather than a Spinto. He also produces a specific distortion and rough sounding voice by combining his powerful chest voice with a throaty placement. This technique distinguishes him as a non-Spinto tenor, which perplexes attentive listeners expected to hear a more delicate lyric voice.
 
Of course, he does not use the proprietary trick that lyricists use to make their voices sound lighter and louder. But, despite this, he creates a perplexing version of his real voice with his style, which is instantly recognisable. So, what is it that makes Bruno Mars so popular? Is it be
