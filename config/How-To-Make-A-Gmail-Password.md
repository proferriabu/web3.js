Each time tha customer change its gmail password, all these scenarios are broken and I should go myself to each scenario and connect every module of gmail again.

Hi there, If you log in with Google and you do not have a password, you can request one by heading to the login page and clicking **forgot password?** . A link to reset your password will be sent to your gmail.
 
Thank you so much. This really helped, I was able to set email and password, change my email and remove Google. For the last step, there might be an update, the link went into my new email (not old email).
 
Before you connect to your Gmail account from Outlook on the web, or add a Gmail account to Outlook, you need to prepare your Gmail account. You need to turn on 2-step verification for Gmail and then create an app password that Office 365 will use with your Gmail address to make the connection.
 
To use an app password with Gmail, you have to first turn on 2-step verification, and then obtain the app password. Once you have an app password, you can use that in combination with your username to connect to Gmail.
 
Re-enter your password if asked, and in the **Set up your phone** step, enter or verify your cell phone. On the next step, enter the verification number sent to your cell phone and choose **Verify**.
 
Note the app password under **Your app password for your device**. You can use this with your Gmail address in the app you're connecting to your Gmail account (or adding you Gmail account to). This combination grants complete access to your Gmail account by the app that is using it.
 
The 16-character app password is displayed with spaces so it is easier to read. When you enter it to the app you want to connect, ignore the spaces and enter it as an unbroken string of 16 characters.
 
Now you're ready to add your Gmail account to Outlook. When you're prompted for a password, you enter this app password for your Gmail account. Don't enter your Gmail password. For instructions on adding your Gmail account to Outlook, see these articles:
 
My Sac State is your secure portal to manage your University account and to access the technology services available to you through the university, including your @csus.edu email. My Sac State Portal has recently been refreshed.
 
Your campus SacLink account allows you access to a variety of campus resources, such as campus email, My Sac State, Office 365, computer labs, and library databases. Generally, the following individuals are eligible for a new account:
 
You can request additional versions of your university email address to make sure campus community members are able to reach your inbox successfully. Email aliases are like automatic email forwards, where messages sent to one address is received by another.
 
Two-Step verification with Duo also known as "multi-factor authentication," provides an extra layer of security in addition to passwords. This extra step ensures University information, transactions or online work is safer from unauthorized access.
 
Passkeys are a safer and easier alternative to passwords. With passkeys, userscan sign in to apps and websites with a biometric sensor (such as a fingerprintor facial recognition), PIN, or pattern, freeing them from having to rememberand manage passwords.
 
Developers and users both hate passwords: they give a poor user experience, they add conversion friction, and they create security liability for both users and developers. Google Password Manager in Android and Chrome reduces the friction through autofill; for developers looking for even further improvements in conversion and security, passkeys and identity federation are the industry's modern approaches.
 
A passkey can meet multifactor authentication requirements in a single step,replacing both a password and OTP (e.g. 6-digit SMS code) to deliver robustprotection against phishing attacks and avoids the UX pain of SMS or app-basedone-time passwords. Since passkeys are standardized, a single implementationenables a passwordless experience across all of a users' devices, acrossdifferent browsers and operating systems.
 
A passkey is a digital credential, tied to a user account and a website or application. Passkeys allow users to authenticate without having to enter a username or password, or provide any additional authentication factor. This technology aims to replace legacy authentication mechanisms such as passwords.
 
When a user wants to sign in to a service that uses passkeys, their browser or operating system will help them select and use the right passkey. The experience is similar to how saved passwords work today. To make sure only the rightful owner can use a passkey, the system will ask them to unlock their device. This may be performed with a biometric sensor (such as a fingerprint or facial recognition), PIN, or pattern.
 
A user can sign into services on any device using a passkey, regardless of where the passkey is stored. For example, a passkey created on a mobile phone can be used to sign in to a website on a separate laptop.
 
Passkeys are intended to be used through operating system infrastructure thatallows passkey managers to create, backup, and make passkeys available to theapplications running on that operating system. On Android, passkeys can bestored in the Google Password Manager, whichsynchronizes passkeys between the user's Android devices that are signed intothe same Google account. Passkeys are securely encrypted on-device before beingsynced, and requires decrypting them on new devices. Users with Android OS 14 orlater can opt to store their passkeys in a compati
