It stars Tom Berenger, Barbara Hershey, Kurtwood Smith, and Steve Reevis. Set in the mountains of northwest Montana, United States, the film is about a bounty hunter who tracks escaped convicts into a remote region and encounters an unknown band of Dog Soldiers from a tribe of Cheyenne Indians. The film was shot on location in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, as well as in Mexico.[4] Critical reviews were mixed to positive, though the film was a box office disappointment.
 
Distraught but skillful bounty hunter Lewis Gates is accompanied by his horse and faithful companion Zip, an Australian cattle dog. Gates tracks three armed escaped convicts into Montana's isolated Oxbow Quadrangle, at the persistence of his unforgiving ex-father-in-law, who blames Gates for his daughter's tragic death. Gates sees the convicts but hears gunshots. Investigating the scene, Gates finds only a bloody scrap of cloth, "enough blood to paint the sheriff's office," a bloody shotgun shell, and an old-fashioned Indian arrow.

Gates takes the arrow to archaeologist Lillian Sloan, who identifies it as a replica of the arrows used by Cheyenne Dog Soldiers. Gates doesn't think it's a replica and, after some library research, develops a long list of people who have disappeared into the Oxbow. He also finds a story of a "wild child" captured in the woods in the early 20th century. Now, he's convinced that the fugitives were killed by a tribe of Dog Soldiers, hardy band of Native Americans who somehow escaped the 1864 Sand Creek massacre and survived for 128 years, secluded in the Montana Wilderness, killing anyone who threatened to find and expose them.
 
Gates convinces Sloan to join him in a search for the band. The two enter the Oxbow and begin to search. They survive many mishaps and bond throughout their journey, eventually venturing deeper into the wilderness than Gates has ever gone before, around 50 miles in.
 
After a week and nearing the end of their supplies, Sloan suggests heading back. As the two are packing their gear, they are suddenly attacked by Cheyenne Indians. Sloan, speaking the Cheyenne language, deescalates the situation, and the two are taken captive by Yellow Wolf. They are taken to the Cheyenne encampment in a valley accessed through a tunnel behind a waterfall, where the duo meet the village leader Spotted Elk. He tells them of the escape and salvation of the Cheyenne 128 years ago, as well as his own run-in with the "white people" when he was a child.
 
Gates and Sloan slowly become friendly with the Cheyenne. However, Yellow Wolf's son is sick, wounded after the gunfight with the convicts. Despite the elder's concerns, Sloan convinces Yellow Wolf to allow Gates to ride into town to obtain antibiotics. In town, Gates robs the pharmacy and is chased by local law enforcement, including Sheriff Deegan, his father-in-law.

After escaping, Gates meets Yellow Wolf in the wilderness, and they return to the Cheyenne camp. By this time, the sheriff has gathered a posse and sets out to hunt down Gates both for robbing the store and to find Gates' female companion, whom the sheriff believes Gates has hiding in the Oxbow.
 
Gates and Sloan continue to grow closer to the Cheyenne, and Sloan discloses that they are indeed the last of their kind. However, Yellow Wolf shows Gates that the sheriff is following his trail and is slowly getting closer to the encampment. Knowing that if discovered, the Cheyenne will fight and die, Gates proposes a solution; using some leftover TNT the Cheyenne had taken from explorers many years earlier, he will create a distraction and allow the Cheyenne to flee deeper inside the Oxbow and live in peace, far away from civilization. Sloan decides to stay with the Cheyenne, which Gates reluctantly agrees to.
 
The two share a passionate kiss, and Gates begins to set up his plan. Gates gives himself up to the sheriff and pleads with him to leave the wilderness. However, the sheriff discovers the hidden tunnel and prepares to enter it. Escaping, Gates attempts to light the TNT with a rifle, but the sheriff stops him and threatens him with a gun to his head. Yellow Wolf appears, surprising the sheriff, and fires an arrow at the TNT, setting it off.
 
Gates and the sheriff are propelled out of the tunnel into the waterfall. Gates saves the sheriff, who is badly wounded. The deputy tells everyone to clear out, and they all head back to town to treat the wounded sheriff and Gates.
 
In Gates' holding cell, the sheriff confronts him about what Gates saw. Gates relents and says some things don't need an explanation; they deserve to remain undiscovered. This seemingly helps smooth over Gates' and the sheriff's relationship.
 
Sloan and the Cheyenne are shown to have successfully escaped. An indeterminate time later, Gates has begun searching for them in heavy snow. Using hints provided by Sloan, he is able to find them. The film ends with Zip running toward Gates as he enters a clearing and a passionate embrace between Sloan and Gates.
 
*Last of the Dogmen* was Tab Murphy's directorial debut; he wrote the screenplay in the early-1980s and producer Joel B. Michaels bought the film rights. The film was budgeted at $25 million and was expected to have an 11-week shooting schedule.[1]
 
*Last of the Dogmen* holds a 69% "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[5] Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the movie 3 out of 4 stars, describing it as "an absorbing story, well told" and carried by Berenger's unpretentious performance, but he felt the final act descended into clichs and failed to live up to the intriguing premise.[6]
 
The American theatrical and home video releases of this film included third-person narration by Wilford Brimley, which is absent from the UK version. The DVD allows the viewer to choose. A limited version available to watch on Netflix until October 19, 2020, featured another alternate narrated by Kurtwood Smith. [*citation needed*]
 
**OneMan's Hero:** My favorite scene in this important and beautiful film of war One Man's Hero. Real story of "Army of San Patricios (Year 1840)," When Cortina (Joaquim De Almeida), request at John Riley (Tom Berenger), what is Marta (Daniela Romo), You for ? And John Riley reply that Marta for he is the Mexico (Messico).This Film is full of Feeling and of Honour, values, from protect and teach in the New Millenium.**Fabio R. from Italy

** **Someone to Watch Over Me:** The relationship between Mike and Claire is so sexy, but notice how Ridley Scott shows NOTHING but some kissing. I think that is what makes the movie sexy. It is so tastefully done. And I felt so sad; why couldn't they be together? I wanted them to be! But then, I knew if they were that everything would change and he'd find it was not worth losing his family. The scene I watched again (twice!) was when they are dancing at the part at her father's music school. The way he looks at her...everything is in his eyes. And he tenderly kisses her hand and holds her...ooooooh! My heart breaks!**E from Texas

** **AtPlay in the Fields of the Lord**: One of my most favorite movies is in At Play in the fields of the Lord. When Tom is in the Forest and comes upon Darryl Hannah who was swimming. He approaches her and begins kissing her, she allows this to happen, but when she realizes what is happening, she runs away. The scene is very touching because Tom's character is so gentle with her, it makes me wish I was in the scene. He is truly a fine, fine actor who can express feelings better than most with just his beautiful eyes! **Rita/Cleveland

** **Platoon/TheBig Chill/Rough Riders:** Platoon was without a doubt Tom Berenger's most piercing role. Under the deft direction of Oliver Stone, his Sgt. Bob Barnes was electrifying in a brutal philosophy of dog eat dog. Barnes and Berenger took us where we'd never dare go on our own. Seeing him in that spoiled me for anything else, though he was adorable as a goofy TV detective in The Big Chill and most credible in Rough Riders . **Bev-Alberta,Canada

** **SomeoneTo Watch Over Me:** My favorite scene is in Someone To Watch Over Me. It hurts when Ellie Keegan is realizing the relationship between her husband Mike and Claire Gregory. He neither can lie at her nor look into her eyes. A difficult situation for both of them. **Silke from Germany
** **
** **Rough Riders:** In the scene in Rough Riders where he fell off the chair and laughing ..it was so natural and effortless. He really enjoyed playing Teddy's character..so huggable and cuddly.He portrayed a really lovable husband who loved his wife deeply...a smasher!! It was so believable that one would think that they were 'real" husband and wife in the film. The nuance suggesting their deep "love" for each other showed how marvelous their chemistry was on screen.Metaphorically speaking, it reminded me of cells....a symbiosis. Amazingly refreshing....truely a fine actor..**Jenny H.from Sth Australia

** **LastRites:** My favorite scene is in Last Rites when he realizes that Angela is married. The look on his face is so sad. When he looks like that I would like to hug him. He looks so lost in that movie.**Janniefrom Holland

** **Sniper/Platoon:** I think Tom is at his best playing a soldier. I thought he was the real deal in Sniper, but in Platoon when he confronts Sheen in their tent and there is a halo of lights behind him and he says " Mister I am your reality" powerful stuff ! **BradC

** **Rustler'sRhapsody/Platoon/Shoot To Kill/Major League:** It's a bit of a tossup between Rustler's Rhapsody, Platoon, Shoot To Kill, and Major League. I'd say the best scene would be, is near the end of Platoon, when
