Once upon a time, I ran a site at gundam.anime.net devoted to the Japanese sci-fi series Mobile Suit Gundam. I closed it in early 2002 to focus on the official English-language site, gundamofficial.com, which in turn shut down at the end of 2012.

It's not just about building, it's about recreating your favourite legends! As you snap, tweak, and customise, let your inner artist shine through. Each piece, each joint, tells a story. What's yours?
 
Q: What are the different grades of Gunpla, and how do they differ?A: Gunpla kits come in various grades, including Entry Grade (EG formally FG) High Grade (HG), Master Grade (MG), Perfect Grade (PG), Real Grade (RG), and Super Deformed (SD). Each grade varies in size, complexity, articulation, and detail, with PG being the most detailed and largest among standard models, while SDs are chibi-style representations of Gundam mobile suits.
 
Start with an EG, HG or SD kit, as they are simpler and require minimal tools. Alternatively choose one of Gundam Express Australia's customised beginner boxes. Ensure you have a pair of plastic nippers and, optionally, a hobby knife and fine grit sandpaper. Follow the instruction manual, cut parts carefully from the runners, and piece them together. Over time, you can advance to more intricate models and detailing techniques.
 
Painting is optional. Kits come pre-coloured, so painting is primarily for those who want to customize or achieve a specific look. If you decide to paint, acrylic or enamel hobby paints are recommended, along with proper priming.

Techniques like panel lining, using decals, weathering, and top-coating can enhance the realism of a kit. Panel lining emphasizes details, decals add logos and warnings, weathering gives a battle-worn look, and top-coating seals everything with a matte or glossy finish.
 
Yes, Bandai regularly releases limited edition, event-exclusive, or special coating versions of kits. These can be more challenging to find and might be pricier than standard releases. Collectors often seek these kits for their uniqueness. Common names included:- P-Bandai (premium Bandai), Gundam Base Limited, and Event Limited
