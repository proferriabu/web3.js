We recommend building ABACUS with cmake to avoid dependency issues. We recommend compiling ABACUS(and possibly its requirements) from the source code using the latest compiler for the best performace. You can also deploy ABACUS **without building** by Docker or conda. Please note that ABACUS only supports Linux; for Windows users, please consider using WSL or docker.

We recommend Intel oneAPI toolkit (former Intel Parallel Studio) as toolchain. The Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit contains Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library (aka MKL), including BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK and FFTW3. The Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit contains Intel MPI Library, and C++ compiler(including MPI compiler).
 
We offer a set of toolchain scripts to compile and install all the requirements automatically and suitable for machine characteristic in an online or offline way. The toolchain can be downloaded with ABACUS repo, which is easily used and can have a convenient installation under HPC environment in both GNU or Intel-oneAPI toolchain. Sometimes, ABACUS by toolchain installation may have highly efficient performance. A Tutorial for using this toolchain can be accessed in bohrium-notebook
 
MKLROOT: If environment variable MKLROOT exists, cmake will take MKL as a preference, i.e. not using LAPACK, ScaLAPACK and FFTW. To disable MKL, unset environment variable MKLROOT, or pass -DMKLROOT=OFF to cmake.

Note: In ABACUS v3.5.1 or earlier, if you install ELPA from source , please add a symlink to avoid the additional include file folder with version name: ln -s elpa/include/elpa-2021.05.002/elpa elpa/include/elpa to help the build system find ELPA headers.
 
If ABACUS is installed into a custom directory using CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX, please add it to your environment variable PATH to locate the correct executable. (Note: my-install-dir should be changed to the location of your installed abacus:/home/your-path/abacus/bin/.)
 
The total thread count (i.e. OpenMP per-process thread count \* MPI process count) should not exceed the number of cores in your machine. To use 4 threads and 4 MPI processes, set the environment variable OMP\_NUM\_THREADS before running mpirun:
 
ABACUS will try to determine the number of threads used by each process if OMP\_NUM\_THREADS is not set. However, it is **required** to set OMP\_NUM\_THREADS before running mpirun to avoid potential performance issues.
 
The project is ready for VS Code development container. Please refer to Developing inside a Container. Choose Open a Remote Window -> Clone a Repository in Container Volume in VS Code command palette, and put the git address of ABACUS when prompted.
 
Conda is a package management system with a separated environment, not requiring system privileges. You can refer to DeepModeling conda FAQ for how to setup a conda environment. A pre-built ABACUS binary with all requirements is available at conda-forge. It supports advanced features including Libxc, LibRI, and DeePKS. Conda will install the GPU-supported version of ABACUS if a valid GPU driver is present. Please refer to the advanced installation guide for more details.
 
And, follow the instructions in Build and Install part above withou manually setting paths to dependencies. See the advanced installation guide for more features. Make sure the environment variables are set before running cmake. Possible command: cmake -B build -DENABLE\_DEEPKS=ON -DENABLE\_LIBXC=ON -DENABLE\_LIBRI=ON.
 
Can anyone help me out with a user and/or installation manual for an Abacus 6R system. This is a hardwired panel with a remote LCD keypad. I think it was bought from RS and installed in 1997. We have carelessly lost the handbooks. I tried to look around the web for DA Systems Abacus without much luck. LCD currently reports 'Trouble' not investigated the cause yet. Perhaps it just needs a new battery.

thanks for the quick reply. I suspected the company had gone bust or been taken over. This version has a remote keypad with a illuminated LCD display. There are a couple of concealed keys marked A and B. I feel I ought to come clean and admit to being a Broadcast Transmitter Engineer. The intruder alarm is monitored 24/7 by our own telemetry system.
 
Came across this super forum couple of weeks ago when I was looking for some pointers on installing a Scantronic 9651 alarm at home. Just had the house rewired and it seemed a good oportunity to put in an alarm system.
 
managed to get a CD off Ebay which had a copy of the user manual on it. Had a look at the alarm system myself and nothing much wrong with it. "Trouble mains" in the log but that just indicates it has suffered a mains outage. still looking for an installation handbook.
 
Run the installer. Request IT support for an "over-the-shoulder" installation if you do not have privileges to install software on your PC. Do not attempt to manually load the installer (.msi file) as an add-in in your Office applications via the native COM Add-ins or Add-ins dialogs.
 
The following Microsoft components (prerequisites) are required by Macabacus. If the installer cannot download or install a missing prerequisite for any reason, download it directly from Microsoft using the applicable link below and install it.
 
The full edition of Microsoft Office must be installed to support sophisticated VSTO add-ins like Macabacus. See our troubleshooting guide if the installer informs you that Office 2016+ is not installed.
 
Macabacus may prompt you for an email address upon starting Excel, PowerPoint, or Word. Enter either (a) the email address of an authorized user to activate Macabacus, if you have already purchased a subscription, or (b) the email address you expect to use to manage your subscription if you later decide to purchase Macabacus to initiate your free trial.
 
You can activate Macabacus at any time using these instructions. If you are a corporate user and your email address is not recognized when you try to activate, ask your Macabacus account administrator to configure your access.
 
This documentation refers to the latest Macabacus version. Some features and descriptions of these features may not apply to older versions of Macabacus. Update your Macabacus software to take advantage of the latest features.
 
The Abacus add in is a collection of custom functions that make writing expressions in Alteryx easier or gives completely new functionality (such as variables). Originally created to make my life easier, they have grown into a powerful extension for Alteryx that can speed up creation of complicated formulae. They focus in on a few key themes:
 
In general, the functions have come either from my own wants for easier ways to do things or more commonly from ideas when answering questions in the community. This document gives an overview of the collection as it stands at version 1.4 (which should be released very soon).
 
The best way to install the add in is to use the Analytic App Installer. This app should download from GitHub, then extract and install the add in into Alteryx. If it doesn't work, you can get the direct download following the instructions below.
 
The two zip files contain the actual add in (AlteryxAbacus.v.1.3.0.0.zip) and the set of test workflows (AlteryxAbacus.v.1.3.0.0.Tests.zip). The Manual.pdf contains a snapshot of the documentation wiki produced when the release was packaged. Finally, the source code is included as both a zip and a tar.gz file.
 
To install onto Alteryx Designer (or Server), you just need to download the main zip file. You can then extract it and run Install.bat. This should install the functions into Alteryx. To uninstall, run Uninstall.bat. These scripts have been tested on Windows 10 but will need administrator access to run. There is also a couple of Windows 7 compatible scripts (Install Win7.bat, Uninstall Win7.bat) included in the zip file.
 
This is a specialist function to allow for a simple VLookup style join. If you take a list of values in ascending order and join together into a comma separated string, then this function will return first value equal to or above the input value.
 
Variables are brand new in version 1.4 and add a whole new dimension of capabilities within formula tool. You can do things like implement a Newton Raphson solver using the generate rows tool or create a grouped running total in a formula tool without resorting the data. **They are very experimental so please use with caution**. Documentation on these new functions is also not yet complete.
 
Variables exist for the execution of a workflow and can be passed between tools. I have not done sufficient experimentation with macros to know how they play with these. The list of functions for working with variables is:
 
This whole project is open source and if you would like to contribute, I would value the submission. All of the code is open source and available on GitHub, below is a quick overview of the code and set up I use to develop the functions.
 
The XML files contain the function definitions (both for the macro functions and the C++ based ones). They are separated by category. The C++ code is all contained in a single Visual Studio project. In general, I again k
