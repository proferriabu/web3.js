SINGAPORE - A police sergeant drew his loaded service revolver and pointed it at a full-time police national serviceman (NSF) after he did not volunteer for a visit to a supermarket as part of community engagement duties.
 
He added that Mohammad Khairul believed he was perceived by his colleagues, including the victim, as someone who often joked around, and this is why the victim did not report the incident immediately.
 
On the delay in reporting the incident, DPP Nair said: "This shows the degree of influence that the uniformed service, and the regular officers representing it, have on the lives of ordinary national servicemen who are there to complete their services. Such offences can be hard to detect and should be deterred."
 
The Model 85 is available in several configurations. These include blued steel, stainless steel, polymer frame, and "Ultralite" variants constructed of aluminum and titanium, with steel lockwork components.
 
Much like Smith & Wesson revolvers, Model 85s can come equipped with exposed, "bobbed" (850), or shrouded (851) hammers. However, there are a number of significant internal differences between the Taurus 85 and similar Smith & Wesson revolvers.[2] Because of these differences, Taurus has been able to keep costs relatively low. However, those same differences can make customization of the Model 85 more expensive.[3]
 
There are numerous cosmetic options, including gold-plated hardware and grips of wood or pearl. The Model 85 is available with either 2" or 3" barrels, is capable of firing +P rated .38 Special rounds, and utilizes a transfer bar safety.
 
Models manufactured after 1997 feature the *Taurus Security System*, which consists of a keyed, quarter-turn style socket-head screw which can be set to prevent the hammer from pivoting back into the frame, thus rendering the weapon inoperative.
 
The View, also known as the model 85VTA, was introduced in 2014.[5] It has a 1.41 inch barrel, an aluminum frame and titanium cylinder, and a clear polycarbonate side plate for an unloaded weight of 9.5 ounces.[6][7][8] Unlike other models, the View is only rated for standard pressure .38 Special ammunition.
 
Reviews on the 85VTA were mixed. Author Massad Ayoob found the View he shot had accuracy problems and lead bullets tended to "prairie dog" (protrude forward from the recoil) and bind the cylinder.[9] Another reviewer did not have those problems when testing the gun.[10] Ultimately, the View was not a commercial success and was pulled from production in December 2014.[11] A revised model, the "No View" with an aluminum side plate replacing the clear one, was introduced in 2015.[12]
 
The pepper-box revolver or simply pepperbox (also "pepper-pot", from its resemblance to the household pepper grinder) is a multiple-barrel repeating firearm that has three or more barrels grouped around a central axis. It mostly appears in the form of a multi-shot handheld firearm. Pepperboxes exist in all ammunition systems: matchlock, wheellock, flintlock, percussion, pinfire, rimfire and centerfire.
 
In the 15th century, several single-shot barrels were attached to a stock, being fired individually by means of a match. Around 1790, pepperboxes were built on the basis of flintlock systems, notably in England. This type of firearm was popular in North America from 1830 until the American civil war.
 
Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) is a form of forensic science which supports investigation, leading the authorities or the police to the facts behind an incident or a crime scene. This course is conducted for Sec 1 and 2 cadets where they will have the opportunity to learn how to solve a crime via the following lessons:
 
The Enhanced CSI is for the Sec 3 cadets where they will have an interactive hands-on experience by going through a series of crime scenes set up in mock-up HDB flats and the Virtual Reality (VR) On-Scene Investigation in Home Team Academy (HTA). This will allow them to have hands-on experience and apply the crime scene management skills which they have learnt.
 
NPCC HQ trains interested Sec 2 cadets and all Sec 3 cadets in the safe handling (Dry Practice) of the 0.22 Smith and Wesson revolver before allowing them to experience the live shoot in the Home Team Academy (HTA) range. Dry Practice sessions will introduce the cadets to the actual revolver in the form of both theory and practical lessons. Cadets will learn the marksmanship principles, safe handling of the revolver and immediate action drills to prepare them for the live shoot. The scores they obtained in Sec 3 during the live shoot will determine if they will receive the Marksmanship badge.
