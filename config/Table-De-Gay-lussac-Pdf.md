Half of the distance between two unbonded atoms of the same element when the electrostatic forces are balanced. These values were determined using several different methods.
 
An integrated supply risk index from 1 (very low risk) to 10 (very high risk). This is calculated by combining the scores for crustal abundance, reserve distribution, production concentration, substitutability, recycling rate and political stability scores.

The availability of suitable substitutes for a given commodity.
High = substitution not possible or very difficult.
Medium = substitution is possible but there may be an economic and/or performance impact
Low = substitution is possible with little or no economic and/or performance impact

The periodic table is an elegant demonstration of properties of elements. You can determine the electron configuration of any atom, simply from its place. You can compare electronegativity, ionization energy, atomic radius, chemical reactivity, and more.
 
So how did Russian chemist Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev and the other creators of the periodic table (arguably six of them) bring order to the elements? How did they create a tool that would ultimately house 118 elements when they knew only 62 of them? And why does Mendeleev get all the credit?
 
So how did chemists of the 19th century define atomic mass? In 1803, English scientist John Dalton published an article in which he assigned hydrogen a weight of 1, and then used compounds of hydrogen to determine the relative weights of the other elements. For example, to determine the atomic mass of oxygen, he used the fact that 1 gram of hydrogen reacts with 8 grams of oxygen to make water. He then could use this ratio of 8:1 to determine the weight of oxygen compared with that of hydrogen.
 
To add even more confusion, in 1805 Prussian scientist Alexander von Humboldt and French scientist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac determined that two volumes of gaseous hydrogen always combined with one volume of gaseous oxygen to form two volumes
 
The mystery was solved in 1811 by Italian scientist Amedeo Carlo Avogadro, who argued that gaseous oxygen is composed not of atoms of oxygen but of molecules of oxygen: O2. Unfortunately, although he was an accomplished scientist, Avogadro was not an accomplished writer, and his hypothesis was not accepted for another 50 years.
 
Interestingly, Meyer regarded periodicity and the similarities among elements in groups as evidence that elements were composed of smaller, more fundamental particles, an idea that Mendeleev himself never accepted.
 
Werthig is valence. The valency of an element was originally a measure of its combining power with other atoms when it forms chemical compounds or molecules. The concept of valence developed in the second half of the 19th century and helped successfully explain the molecular structure of inorganic and organic compounds.
 
Mendeleev went beyond just creating a table, however; he argued that the organization of elements reflected an underlying periodic law. For example, while Meyer switched the placement of tellurium and iodine, Mendeleev switched them and argued that the atomic mass of one of them had to be wrong. (The atomic masses were not, in fact, wrong, because periodicity turns out to be based on atomic number, not atomic mass.) Mendeleev corrected the masses of several elements on the basis of his table, and these corrections were later experimentally validated.

You can see one here on the left. I had never heard of these things until I spent a couple summers working the register at Party City as a teenager. If a customer paid with any bills larger than a $20, I was supposed to mark it with one of these pens. If the mark was yellow, then it was real, legal tender. If the mark immediately darkened, then I was looking at funny money.
 
And while Davy was deep in enemy territory, he was not constantly looking over his shoulder in fear for his life. He was there on the personal invitation of the Emperor himself. Napoleon wished to award Davy for his many valuable contributions to science.
 
For instance: Davy had coincidentally just gotten married, and his new bride also received special dispensation to cross the firing line. Lots of newlyweds honeymoon in Paris; rarely do they make passage on a ship carrying prisoners of war. Upon arrival, the welcome they received was less of a red carpet for guests of the Emperor, and more akin to the pat-down one receives at airport security. Davy was especially amused that guards saw fit to search his pockets, his clothes, and even his shoes before admitting entry.
 
And when Mrs. Davy went for a walk in the Tuileries (twillerie) Gardens, she quickly learned that her the hat she wore was embarrassingly out of touch with the contemporary sartorial trends that side of the Channel. She attracted such a crowd of tittering Parisiennes that she had to be escorted off the premises.
 
In between such awkward episodes as these, Professor Davy found time to inspect samples of ione with his traveling chemistry lab. He confirmed that this certainly was a new element, but offered one suggestion:
 
Like chlorine, iodine is useful as an antiseptic. Like fluorine, we artificially supplement our diets with iodine. But while a fluorine deficiency will lead to poor dental health, a lack of iodine can have much greater consequences.
 
For a long time, the only thing people really knew about this syndrome was that some places seemed more susceptible than others. For instance, in the 1800s, nearly five percent of people born in the Swiss Alps were afflicted to some degree or another.8 9 10
 
It was in that same century that doctors slowly started to draw connections. For instance, Jean-Baptiste Boussingault (boos-ahn-ghool) discovered in 1831 that adding a little sea salt to meals could stave off goiter, and in the 1850s, Adolphe Chatin found a correlation between prevalence of cretinism and the iodine content in local soil.11 12 13 14
 
In the event of a nuclear disaster, one of the greatest health threats comes from radioactive fallout. The body will absorb radioactive isotopes of elements that it normally encounters as stable, and iodine is one of them.
 
**17.** Blow up two balloons to the same size, about 6 inches in diameter. Place the opening of one balloon over the opening of each plastic bottle. Make sure the air doesn't leak out and that both balloons still have the same volume. Leave one bottle on the table and place the other in the hot water bath. Use the clamp to hold the bottle in position, so that it does not float. Describe what
