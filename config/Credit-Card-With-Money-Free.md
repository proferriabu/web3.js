From time to time we may offer to you the benefit of our U.S. Bank ExtendPay Plans, which allow you to pay off balances in fixed monthly payments over time and still avoid paying interest charges on new Purchases. You may designate up to 50% of your credit card line ($100 minimum) in eligible credit card purchases and pay in monthly installments with just a small fixed monthly fee. Only Purchase balances are eligible for ExtendPayPlans. Transactions identified as Advances or Balance Transfers (as defined in your Cardmember Agreement), and any interest or fees, including Annual Fee, do not apply. The only Purchases that will appear as "Eligible Purchases" in the enrollment process are Purchases that were made within 60 days prior to signing up for an ExtendPay Plan, are over $100, and are less than your Purchase balance when you sign up for an ExtendPay Plan. Any unpaid balance remaining on an ExtendPay Plan after the chosen pay-back period will be subject to the APR and minimum payment calculation for purchases outlined in the Cardmember Agreement.
