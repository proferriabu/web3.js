We have run into this exact same behavior, which was detected with our endpoint software. Is it normal for DropBox to operate in this way? I'm concerned that someone may have maliciously hijacked powershell to dump credentials to a dropbox account.
 
I've tried extending my timeout ($global:CurrentNCController.TimeoutMsec=600000), and that helped some, but I'm still getting this error. The system I'm connecting from is on the same subnet, and I can HTTPS or SSH into the system with no delay or issue. Running "volume snapshot show -vserver -volume " via SSH runs instantly, no delay...but running "Get-NCSnapshot -vserver -volume " takes forever...it will list a couple of snapshots, then give that warning message.
 
I found a workaround fix. I added -ZapiCall to the end of my powershell call to the NetApp, and that took care of it. There must be something with the REST version of the call for Get-NCSnapshot that doesn't jive with ONTAP 9.12.1P4.
 
Thanks for this! I'm fetching timestamps of oldest and latest snapshots for each volume with these kind of calls:

Get-NcSnapshot -volume $name | Sort-Object -Property created | Select-Object -first 1 -ExpandProperty Created
 
Since Get-NcSnapshot now takes like a minute for \*each\* snapshot, a call like that would take forever. "-ZapiCall" fixed it but I assume that just uses the old, soon to be depreciated, API so let's hope they get the PowerShell module fixed.
 
I have a workflow that clones and fills in Excel templates with requests for another department. Said department takes PDFs, so I mashed together a Powershell script that converts the Excel files in a specified folder into PDFs:

When I found & ran it, I realized Alteryx was not opening and running the generated script; specifying the working directory allowed the powershell script to run as expected. In this case, my workflow lives in a local Test folder.
 
PowerShell is an object-oriented automation engine and scripting language with an interactive command-line shell that Microsoft developed to help IT professionals configure systems and automate administrative tasks.
 
Built on the .NET framework, PowerShell works with objects, whereas most command-line shells are based on text. PowerShell is a mature and well-proven automation tool for system administrators employed in both IT departments and external entities, such as managed service providers, because of its scripting capabilities.
 
PowerShell originated as a proprietary offering that was only available on Windows. Today, PowerShell is available by default on most recent Windows systems; simply type "powershell" into the Windows search bar to locate the PowerShell app. In 2016, Microsoft open sourced PowerShell and made it available on Linux and macOS.
 
Microsoft designed PowerShell to automate system tasks, such as batch processing, and to create system management tools for commonly implemented processes. The PowerShell language, similar to Perl, offers several ways to automate tasks:
 
Admins can use PowerShell to handle a wide range of activities. It can extract information on OSes, such as the specific version and service pack levels. "PowerShell providers" are programs that make data contained in specialized data stores accessible at the command line. Those data stores include file system drives and Windows registries.
 
PowerShell also serves as the replacement for Microsoft's Command Prompt, which dates back to DOS. Microsoft, for example, made PowerShell the default command-line interface (CLI) for Windows 10 as of build 14791. PowerShell's role as a command-line shell is how most users become acquainted with the technology.
 
The most appealing reason to use any kind of CLI is the potential for precise and repeatable control over a desired action or task flow that is difficult, or even impossible, to replicate with a traditional GUI.
 
Consider using a GUI to perform an intricate task. It can involve clicking buttons, moving sliders, selecting files from multilayered menus and other actions. GUIs were designed to be comfortable for humans to use, but they can be time-consuming, cumbersome and error-prone -- especially when a task must be repeated hundreds or thousands of times.
 
In contrast, PowerShell offers a CLI with a mature and detailed scripting language that enables a user with rudimentary programming skills to craft a detailed set of specific instructions, or a script, for a desired task. The task can be just about anything, from finding a desired file to describing a desired state configuration for the system or other systems. Once the script is created, it can be saved as a file and executed with a click, enabling the same task to be repeated exactly the same way for any number of repetitions. Different scripts can also be chained together to create complex and highly detailed tasks.
 
These simple-sounding characteristics are absolutely essential for automation and scalability -- letting the computer do the work as much as is needed for the environment. Thus, PowerShell can help system administrators perform complex and highly repetitive tasks with a high level of automation and accuracy that a GUI simply can't replicate.
 
**Discoverability** **.** Users can discover PowerShell's features using cmdlets, such as Get-Command, which creates a list of all the commands -- including cmdlets and functions -- available on a given computer. Parameters can be used to narrow the scope of the search.
 
**Help capabilities** **.** Users can learn more about PowerShell principles and particular components, such as cmdlets, through the Get-Help cmdlet. The -online parameter provides access to help articles on the web if available for a particular topic.
 
**Remote commands** **.** Admins can perform remote operations on one or multiple computers, taking advantage of technologies such as Windows Management Instrumentation and WS-Management. The WS-Management protocol, for example, lets users run PowerShell commands and scripts on remote computers.
 
**Pipelining** **.** With PowerShell, commands can be linked together through the pipe operator, symbolized as |. This approach lets the output from a given command become the input for the next command in the pipeline sequence. The PowerShell pipeline lets objects, rather than text strings, flow from one cmdlet to another. This powerful capability is important for complex and detailed automation scripts.
 
With PowerShell 4.0, Microsoft introduced a configuration management platform called Desired State Configuration (DSC), which admins can use to set a specific configuration for a server. After the admin defines the server settings, PowerShell ensures the target nodes retain that desired state. DSC has two modes of operation: push mode and pull mode.
 
In push mode, a server sends notifications to the nodes. It's a one-way communication, where the admin sends notifications from a workstation. Setup costs are less because management runs from a device, but a notification can get lost if the device isn't connected to the network.
 
In pull mode, the IT department creates a pull server with the configuration details of each node using a Managed Object Format file. Each node contacts the pull server to check for a new configuration. If the new configuration is available, the pull server sends the configuration to the node. Admins can manage all devices regardless of their network connection. When a device connects to the network, it automatically contacts the pull server to check for a new configuration.
 
Admins use these resources to configure components, such as registry keys and Windows services, or to create and manage local users through a configuration script. For instance, the File resource manages files and folders, the Environment resource manages environment variables and the Registry resource manages the registry keys of a node. Windows default, or built-in, DSC resources include the following:
 
PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE), introduced by Microsoft in PowerShell version 2.0, is a PowerShell host application used to write, test and debug scripts or write commands in a Windows GUI. To access the ISE, click **Start**, select **Windows PowerShell** and choose **Windows PowerShell ISE**. As an alternative, simply type powershell\_ise.exe in the command shell or Windows Run box.
 
PowerShell ISE has sophisticated features that are familiar to Windows users. For instance, a user can highlight and copy a portion of a PowerShell command with a mouse or with the Shift + Arrow hot-key combination. The user can also paste the content anywhere in the editor window.
