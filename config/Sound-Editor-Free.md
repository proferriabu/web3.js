So I think there's an actual issue with the conversion tool? Running Windows 10, I installed the 2013 dependency, 2015's version literally won't install because there's a newer version already installed. I drag in a WAV file, and it says "converting to WAV" and then it fails. I just dragged in a text file with the YouTube link - as well as a couple MP3 files as a test - both have converted to WAV, then to WEM, no issues.

Are we not supposed to drag in a WAV file? Are we supposed to be using other software for WAV to WEM? I can compromise with using YouTube links in a text file, that's not an issue for me at all, but I'm not sure how the tool says to "drag in a WAV file" only for it to not convert.

Which issue specifically? I'm using SE every other day to edit commentary in WWE2K14 for Xbox 360 and it's working like a charm. However, if you're speaking about the Sound Convertor tool on the Legacy WWE2K14/360 dropdown, then yes, that doesn't work. Fails for me every time. I'm using an older version of WWise to create my WEMS for 2K14. A longer step and kind of a pain, but after you get the WEM created, it inserts perfectly into the game.
 
When that happened to me it was because the WEM I had created and imported was not done correctly. I don't know if you made a backup save of your sound file (I'm hoping you did), but I just reinserted my last working sound file and it worked fine.
 
Hi, every time I open the ra\_1.pck file in sound editor the sounds won't play and the game crashes when I try to load a match, I think for some reason it's getting corrupted. Is this happening to anyone else or does anyone know a fix? It's perfectly fine vanilla but I want to change the call names for a few of my modded wrestlers and championships.
 
Anyone know how to fix sound tool not working? It's fine when i used before. After two week when i decide to change new music on the sound editor when i want to the sound editor it not functional when i click open. Its stay hidden on my dekstop.
 
I have 2k23 on steam and fully downloaded sound editor, I've tried the in program converter to convert both .mp3 and .wav to .wem files, and it keeps coming up with an error (no error code), saying failed to convert to .wem. I've tried to convert files myself, which did nothing, error still persists. I did all the steps according to the instructions, and even uninstalled and redownloaded just in case it was my fault somehow, but no luck. if there's something I'm missing, please let me know.
 
Download the new driver for the Windows 64-bit and then check to see if this helps your issue. Definitely restart your computer after updating your driver. Let me know what the outcome is after doing so, and if you still need help.

Now delete your projects .ini folders and save the changes made. Re-open your project and check to see if sounds work at all within the engine. Let me know if you have attempted this suggestions, and if it worked for you.
 
Sound Editors are responsible for creating all the sounds in a movie or TV show (excluding music). Usually sound editing is divided into specific specialized tasks: dialogue, sound effects and design, Foley and music editing. All these editors prepare sounds for the final mix.
 
In these very emotional situations, I learned to be strong. Bullies take away my sword and expect me to fight without a sword? I can still fight with a bamboo stick, moving forward with many small, light footsteps. I fight for those who follow who also refuse to succumb to injustice and abuse.
 
Through a helpful network of alumni from the Music Engineering program I went through at UM, a guy named Myron Nettinga helped me get my first union sound editing job just three months out of college at the now-defunct Todd-AO. He gave me some great creative guidance, and I got thrown directly into the fire.
 
Brad North is a Supervising Sound Editor for television and film. He has 22+ years of experience and has worked on shows such as Stranger Things, Bosch, Love, Death & Robots, Shadow and Bone, Mare of Easttown, Station Eleven, and Watchmen.
 
Brad North: Growing up I had a passion for music and movies. While in high school, I thought that a career path for me could be composing for feature films. During that time, Jurassic Park came out. There was a special on TV with Gary Rydstrom on how they did the sound for Jurassic Park. They showed how they made the sounds for the dinosaurs and how they crafted a scene by taking out the music and only hearing feet, and then it builds from there. I thought that was really cool and interesting. It exposed me to post-production sound, so I looked into it. I ended up going to Full Sail in Florida and got a Recording Arts degree.
 
**DS: Jurassic Park was a big inspiration for me too. One of the big sound moments in that film that made me realize how powerful sound was, was the dinosaur footsteps and the cup of water. You see the vibrating in the cup of water and hear the footsteps. It just built this tension. It was very cool.**
 
BN: I have the Krotos Everything Bundle, so it comes with a lot of library sounds. I love the Krotos library. The big effects are dynamic and interesting. The hard effects sounds are well recorded and have some life. The Foley and movement libraries sound full and real.
 
Does anyone have any experience with the sound editor? In particular, I'm trying to figure out how that make a unit sound heard by all players in the game or just by the player playing the unit. 

Some of these flags look like complete gibberish to me. Any help is appreciated.
 
After filming has wrapped, sound effects have been added, the music recorded or licensed, and all cuts and changes have been approved, a movie enters the production stage called picture lock. That's when the supervising sound editor begins the painstaking process of fashioning a final soundtrack from a film's many sonic components. These include production sound (the dialogue and ambient noises captured during shooting), foley (reproduced sounds), ADR (automated dialogue replacement), walla (crowd noises), sound effects, and music.
 
While supervising sound editors may do a certain amount of editing themselves, their primary job is to oversee the work of a full team of dialogue editors, sound effects editors, and music editors, ensuring that post-production sound stays on schedule.
 
Once the effects and dialogue are pristine and perfectly situated within the film, the supervising sound editor stitches them together with the composer's score and the music supervisor's song selections, creating a complete sound experience to accompany the moving picture. The work is done using a DAW (digital audio workstation), which stores all the sounds in separate files and allows the editor to synchronize each one with particular frames in the film. When the sound editor's job is finished, the completed soundtrack is sent off to a re-recording mixer to be balanced and mastered, a process for which the supervising sound editor is likely to be present.
 
This is the highest position in the audio post-production team in the film and TV industries. Many supervising sound editors start out as audio interns with a network or studio. From there, one must typically choose a path: focusing on dialogue, music, or effects. Those who become supervising sound editors are likely to cycle through at least two or possibly all three of these tracks, gaining deep knowledge of the art of sound editing and the film industry's conventions. Eventually, a senior editor may be selected as an assistant supervising sound editor on a film, and in a subsequent project become the supervising sound editor.
 
Sound editors usually work as freelancers, hired by film and television producers on a per-project basis. They can also be employed full-time by post-production sound studios, and in rare cases by film or television studios.
 
While the other sound editors spend the bulk of their work days at an audio workstation with headphones on, supervising sound editors do not have that luxury. Their primary responsibility is the soundtrack, and they must communicate, set goals, build long-term schedules, and motivate the rest of the team so that it's ready in time. In other words, they must lead. Because deadlines are often pressing in this industry, it's vital to remain clear-headed and focused while under pressure. Also important is a passion for visual media and a real feel for how sound and images work together to create compelling art and entertainment.
 
Supervising sound editors have intense schedules when working on a film, which might last anywhere from a few weeks to several months, and sometimes toil more than 12 hours per day. Fortunately, they get to take a break from this rapid pace when the work is done, as most sound editors are freelance and will need to find a new project. Sound editors in the television industry do similar work, but on a smaller scale, in a shorter time frame, and with more consistent employment prospects, although that depends on the success of the show.
 
I am a Sound Effects person, but my training was in Film Mixing. I love editing and conceptualising Sound Effects, but my role in the last few ears has moved into Supervising a crew of outstanding Sound Editors, so I do less of the editing - and more wishing I did!
