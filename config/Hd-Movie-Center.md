At appears to be favored in mathematical contexts; the others are found in a broad range of contexts. Center around, a standard idiom, has often been objected to as illogical. The logic on which the objections are based is irrelevant, since center around is an idiom and idioms have their own logic. Center on is currently more common in edited prose, and revolve around and similar verbs are available if you want to avoid center around.

Three in five college students do not have enough to eat or a stable place to live, and millions of students experience basic needs insecurity, including a lack of access to adequate housing, food, health care, child care, internet connectivity, transportation, and mental health services. Basic needs insecurity is a social determinant of health that hampers postsecondary student success, inhibits social mobility, and deepens inequities. We are changing the unjust status quo.

The Patent and Trademark Resource Center Program manages a nationwide network of academic, public, and state libraries that have been designated a Patent and Trademark Resource Center (PTRC). These resource centers provide the public with various trademark and patent assistance.
 
If you want to patent an invention or register a trademark, you don't have to navigate the process by yourself. PTRC representatives are trained to help inventors and small businesses find the information they need to protect their intellectual property (IP).
 
Sea ice data is updated daily, with a one-day lag. The orange line in extent and concentration images (left and middle) and the gray line in the time series (right) indicate 1981 to 2010 average extent for the day shown. The graph also includes lines for selected earlier years, for comparison. Learn about update delays and other problems which occasionally occur in near-real-time data. Read about the data.
 
July is the warmest month in the Arctic and hence also the month of peak sea ice loss. As of the middle of July 2024, extent is declining at an above average pace. Sea is mostly gone in Hudson Bay, and there has been extensive retreat in the Barents and Laptev Seas. Satellite data reveal a small area of unusually dense sea ice formed last winter near Wrangel Island.
 
On July 15, 2024, halfway through the month, sea ice extent stood at 8.16 million square kilometers (3.15 million square miles), ranking seventh lowest in the satellite passive microwave record for that date. The rate of ice loss from July 1 to July 15 of 121,000 square kilometers (47,000 square miles) per day was above the average value of 89,000 square kilometers (34,000 square miles) per day. As assessed using the NSIDC sea ice spatial comparison tool, ice losses over the past two weeks have been most notable along the Eurasian coast, particularly over the northern Barents and Laptev Seas (Figure 1b). Some ice still remains in western Hudson Bay. Data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2) instrument aboard the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission-Water (GCOM-W) satellite shows areas of low concentration ice north of Alaska and in the East Siberian Sea, interspersed with areas of more compact ice, especially south and east of Wrangel Island (Figure 1c). Ice over the central Arctic Ocean remains compact.
 
Air temperature at the 925 hPa level (about 2,500 feet above the surface) averaged over the first two weeks of July was 2 to 6 degrees Celsius (4 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit) above average over the Laptev Sea, where substantial sea ice losses have been observed so far in the month (Figure 2a). Temperatures were also 2 to 4 degrees Celsius (4 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit) below average extending from the East Siberian Sea, across the Beaufort Sea, and in the western Canadian Arctic Archipelago. In contrast to June 2024, which was characterized by a strong Beaufort High, the sea level pattern for the first two weeks of July 2024 features below average pressure covering much of the Arctic Ocean, with a small area of above-average pressures centered over the Laptev Sea (Figure 2b).
 
Colleagues at the University of Washington Polar Science Center maintain maps of sea surface temperature over the Arctic region. Fairly high sea surface temperatures of 3 to 5 degrees Celsius (37 to 41 degrees Fahrenheit) prevail along parts of the Siberian coast where the sea ice retreated earlier this season. Fairly warm waters are also creeping into the eastern Chukchi Sea.
 
Winds from the east-southeast in spring have tightly packed sea ice between Wrangel Island and mainland Siberia. Sea ice concentrations in this wedge-shaped area in the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2) mapping is higher than the other regions along the Siberian coast (Figure 1c). The area on the downwind side of open water can be seen both in the AMSR-2 mapping and in an image from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite from July 7 (Figure 4a). Looking back at the sea level pressure field from earlier in the season, June 1 to June 15, points to winds that would compact sea ice into this region between the island and the mainland (Figure 4b).
