Study and memorise word families. Understanding the base form of a word and how it changes into different parts of speech can be incredibly helpful. For example, from 'protect', you should know 'protection' (noun), 'protective' (adjective), and 'protectively' (adverb).
 
Practise word formation by writing sentences or short paragraphs using a specific set of words. This not only helps with memorisation but also with understanding how these words fit into broader linguistic structures.
 
If you are sure that the word is, for example, an adjective but you can't think what the exact word is, try thinking of "usual" prefixes and suffixes.

Perhaps it needs the suffix "ive" or the prefix "de". Try a few out and see which ones seem to be best. This can also be done with nouns and verbs.

Remember one thing: you know more English than you think you do! If you don't try, when you see the answer, you'll say "I knew that!" so think a little first, try to build your way to the answer!
 
Read the entire text/sentence to get a good idea of context. What "type" of word do you need? It's good practice to go through one of these exercises just thinking about "what category of word?" and "positive or negative?" Is it a positive noun (competitiveness) or a negative adjective (unfriendly). Always be thinking in those terms and it will make the word formation part of the Use of English exam easier.

With this lesson, students talk about funding sources, address scepticism and watch a video about common myths of crowdfunding. They also explore vocabulary, analyse successful crowdfunding campaigns and create their own projects.
 
With this speaking lesson plan, students watch a video about growth and fixed mindsets and get plenty of opportunities to discuss them. They also learn some collocations referring to challenges and development, as well as practise word formation.
 
This lesson plan deals with synchronous and asynchronous communication. Apart from doing listening comprehension tasks, students will build adjectives with negative prefixes and learn some communication idioms.
 
This lesson plan about recruitment deals with unconscious bias among recruiters. The worksheet includes a lot of vocabulary as well as word formation tasks and includes a TED Talk by Gail Tolstoi-Miller.

This TinyTap includes a corpus-based list of word families of the word PASS, followed by sentence-based word-formation exercises. You can use this activity to prepare for Cambridge English examinations and English language proficiency competitions worldwide, or simply to expand vocabulary in general and academic contexts.
 
In this post, I am presenting 5 games that help students **recognize and form different parts of speech**. They are especially useful for students preparing for **Cambridge exams** (First and Advanced). I have been using these activities to revise and practice vocabulary and to offer some alternatives to typical Use of English exercises.
 
**Note: Even though these games serve mainly for revision purposes, I try to include some follow-up activities where the target words from each game are used in context (using the words in sentences, creating a dialogue, asking questions containing the target words, exam-type exercises, etc.)**
 
The maze is perfect for revising suffixes and prefixes. Students try to exit the maze looking for words governed by the same word formation rule. In the maze below the task is to find the right path choosing adjectives whose opposites start with the prefix in-. My other favourite option is looking for nouns that end with -ence (as opposed to -ance).
 
I got the idea for this activity after stumbling upon **this one**. Prepare two sets of word card: chosen prefixes/suffixes and words that go with them to create new ones. Students select one card from the Words pile and try to match it with the appropriate prefix /suffix to make a new word, note the new word down, put the Words card aside, and continue until they have no Words cards left. They can play individually/in pairs against the clock or against each other to make as many correct words as possible.
 
I used to play a similar game with my 8-year-olds: kids sit in a circle and pass the ball around saying words from a given category (e.g. animals). I adapted it for the needs of my teenage students and it was an instant hit.
 
Students stand/sit in a circle, you (or any other student) select a category (word building suffix or prefix), students pass the ball around saying the words without repeating them and you monitor whether they are correct. The first person to say the wrong word/not say anything at all is eliminated (leaves the circle). The game goes on until there are two players left. Change suffixes/prefixes for each new round.
 
Hi Gosia,
Thanks very much. Im constantly in search for something like this. I love word formation games and activities, and just absolutely loved the first one. Im gonna use it tomorrow with my INtermediate students.
Have a fantastic day!
 
This is an advanced course in spoken and written contemporary standard Russian, intended for students who have completed the equivalent of four semesters of college-level Russian, or have placed into the course by exam. The course strengthens grammatical control and develops proficiency in speaking, reading, listening, and writing. Students will learn to summarize, develop narration, and create connected paragraphs in speech and writing. The will also study complex grammatical structures, such as participles and gerunds, and syntactic constructions, such as subordination. They will broaden their vocabulary through the study of word-formation. This course covers many elements of modern life in the Russian-speaking world, such as education, employment, leisure and youth culture, through authentic target-language texts, websites, media (including films and music) and other materials. It is highly recommended that all 860:301 also take Advanced Russian Conversation I.
 
Depending on its size, each tenant has access to a set amount of CPU resources allocated for running advanced hunting queries. For detailed information about various usage parameters, read about advanced hunting quotas and usage parameters.
 
After running your query, you can see the execution time and its resource usage (Low, Medium, High). High indicates that the query took more resources to run and could be improved to return results more efficiently.
 
This default behavior can leave out important information from the left table that can provide useful insight. For example, the query below will only show one email containing a particular attachment, even if that same attachment was sent using multiple emails messages:
 
The **broadcast hint** helps when the left table is small (up to 100,000 records) and the right table is extremely large. For example, the query below is trying to join a few emails that have specific subjects with all messages containing links in the EmailUrlInfo table:
 
While a single email can be part of multiple events, the example below is not an efficient use of summarize because a network message ID for an individual email always comes with a unique sender address.
 
The following example is a more efficient use of summarize because there can be multiple distinct instances of a sender address sending email to the same recipient address. Such combinations are less distinct and are likely to have duplicates.
 
To get a unique identifier for a process on a specific machine, use the process ID together with the process creation time. When you join or summarize data around processes, include columns for the machine identifier (either DeviceId or DeviceName), the process ID (ProcessId or InitiatingProcessId), and the process creation time (ProcessCreationTime or InitiatingProcessCreationTime)
 
There are numerous ways to construct a command line to accomplish a task. For example, an attacker could reference an image file without a path, without a file extension, using environment variables, or with quotes. The attacker could also change the order of parameters or add multiple quotes and spaces.
 
To incorporate long lists or large tables into your query, use the externaldata operator to ingest data from a specified URI. You can get data from files in TXT, CSV, JSON, or other formats. The example below shows how you can utilize the extensive list of malware SHA-256 hashes provided by MalwareBazaar (abuse.ch) to check attachments on emails:
 
Some tables in this article might not be available in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Turn on Microsoft Defender XDR to hunt for threats using more data sources. You can move your advanced hunting workflows from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to Microsoft Defender XDR by following the steps in Migrate advanced hunting queries from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
 
The best thing you can do to improve your C1 listening skills is watch Youtube videos on different genres (vloggs, interviews, working out, cooking recipes, DIY...) and watch shows in English with English subtitles.
