How do I install Fuji Xerox DocuPrint M225DW multi function Printer& Scanner to my new Macbook Pro M1. This Printer has wifi printing capabilities and I would like to wirelessly print documents from my MAcBook Pro. Any help would be greatly appreciated...

With the device networked, and powered, visit System Preferences > Printers & Scanners panel. Add your device [+], selecting the globe on the toolbar of the Add Printer panel. Enter the static IP address of the printer, and for the Protocol, choose AirPrint. Then click Add.
 
I did what you recommended in your email above and re-added the device(Fuji Xerox Docuprint M225 dw) on my Macbook Pro ). However the scan option is not showing up when I select the printer. refer Macbook Pro Screenshot ?
 
I am attaching the screenshots of my older MacBook Air where the Scan options were available. If you examine the screenshot further you will see the 2nd line Kind : Fuji Xerox Docuprint M225dw **CUPS**mentioned. The other 2 Printer Options have Kind : Fuji Xerox Docuprint M225dw CUPS-**Airprint**
 
You should not install the Fuji Xerox printer/scanner drivers when using AirPrint as it is supposed to provide that functionality without the vendor drivers whose installation may compromise the AirPrint capability. AirPrint should also allow you to detect and scan using Apple's included Image Capture or Preview utilities.

For people to be able to compare page yields between different printers and manufacturers, there is one industry-wide testing methodology. Canon, HP, Epson, Lexmark and other industry leading manufacturers have worked closely with the InternationalStandards Organization (ISO) to establish this standard. It is called "ISO/IEC 24711".
 
Page yield data should be used as a starting point for comparison purposes, and not to predict the exact yield you will get from your printer and cartridge. Likewise, the declared yield is not intended to be the minimum number of pages that the cartridge will print. Rather, page yield data is meant to estimate the average yield expected from a particular cartridge when measured using the ISO test methodology in connection with a designated printer system. Individual cartridges can perform above and below this average due to variation in the cartridge manufacturing process. Additionally, actual yield varies considerably based on factors such as the content of printed pages, typical printer job size, the environmental conditions during operation and the amount of color printing relative to monochrome printing.
 
- The test methodology that manufacturers should use to determine ink cartridge yields
- The way manufacturers should declare yield values from these test results
- The appropriate method of describing the yield of cartridge in documentation supplied to the consumer
 
Although the ISO standard does not provide a specified document for photo printing, most manufacturers print something like these selected 24 photos on 10x15cm size Glossy Photo Paper continuously, with the default driver settings for the paper using standard Windows printer drivers in borderless printing mode. This complies with ISO methodology ISO/IEC 24711.
 
Selected patterns like this are used only for A3+ printers. The inkjet yields are determined by printing a 279.4x355.6mm (11"x14") image like this on A3+ size Glossy Photo Paper continuously with the default driver settings for this paper, using standard Windows printer drivers.
 
In recent years, Laser Printer and Multi Functional Product yield data has been calculated using standard ISO test methodologies.The specific ISO/IEC standard used depends upon whether the printer is a monochrome or color device. ISO provides different methodologies for testing color and monochrome printer yields. Previous to the introduction of the ISO/IEC yield methodologies, manufacturers usually had their own proprietary yield test methodology based on 5% coverage which used a methodology similar in many ways to the ISO yield methodology.
 
Some printers include an "introductory" or "starter" cartridge in the printer box, which may print less than the cartridges we have here on the Printzone site. The printer packaging will usually indicate whether introductory cartridges are included with the printer.
 
Under the ISO/IEC 19752 testing guidelines, a standard page is printed continuously until the cartridge reaches end-of-life. An example of the standard page shown is shown at right. The actual test page can be found at www.iso.org/jtc1/sc28.
 
ISO/IEC 19752 methodology has been used by most manufacturers to test monochrome printer yields since its introduction in 2004. A small number of toner cartridges still being sold provide page yield based upon 5% coverage methodology.
 
**Colour test pages**
Under the ISO/IEC 19798 testing guidelines, a standard set of five pages is printed continuously until the cartridge reaches end-of-life. The five standard pages shown at right consist of a mix of text and graphics, and a mix of black and color. These standards for color printers were introduced after the publication of the standard at the end of 2006.
 
Actual yield that a customer experiences can vary depending upon the printed content on the page. Highly "dense" documents, such as the text document at right, may cause cartridges to yield fewer pages than the ISO standard, while less dense ones such as the organisation chart far right will typically cause the cartridge to yield more pages than the standard.
 
Some colours may be used more on a page than others - this will cause some cartridges to be depleted quicker than others, and result in a lower page yield - for example the page at right with a heavy use of cyan.
 
Buy with confidence at Printzone. We've been in the printer cartidge business since 1999 and have served tens of thousands of customers just like you. Why do people keep coming back to Printzone? Because we've built a reputation for superior customer service, a wide range, and keen prices.
 
I finally found that you had to manually tell the driver about the presence of the duplex unit. This is done through Control Panel > Printers & Devices > right-click your printer > Printer Properties.
