AWS Mainframe Modernization helps you modernize your mainframe applications to AWS managed runtime environments. It provides tools and resources to help you plan and implement migration and modernization. You can analyze your existing mainframe applications, develop or update them using COBOL or PL/I, and implement an automated pipeline for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of the applications. You can choose between automated refactoring and replatforming patterns, depending on your clients' needs. If you are a consultant helping a client migrate their mainframe workloads, you can use AWS Mainframe Modernization tools for all phases of the migration and modernization journey, from initial planning to post-migration cloud operations.

You can use AWS Mainframe Modernization to help you efficiently create and manage the runtime environment on AWS for your mainframe applications, as well as to manage and monitor your modernized applications.
 
Have you engaged with AWS Mainframe Migration Competency Partners or AWS Professional Services for your mainframe modernization project? If not, we highly recommend that you engage experts for your project.

The features and use cases of AWS Mainframe Modernization support an evolutionary modernization approach, which provides short-term wins by improving agility and plenty of opportunities to optimize and innovate later on. For more information, see Modernization approach.
 
Refactor: powered by AWS Blu Age, you can use refactoring to convert legacy application programming languages, to create macroservices or microservices, and to modernize user interfaces (UIs) and application software stacks.
 
AWS Blu Insights is now available from the AWS Management Console through single sign-on. You do not have to manage separate AWS Blu Insights credentials any longer. You can access both the AWS AWS Blu Age Codebase and Transformation Center features directly from the AWS Management Console.
 
Developer IDE: AWS Mainframe Modernization offers an on-demand integrated development environment (IDE) so developers can write code quicker with smart editing and debugging, instant code compilation, and unit testing.
 
Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD): AWS Mainframe Modernization's CI/CD feature helps application development teams deliver code changes more frequently and reliably, which accelerates migration speed, increases quality, and helps reduce time-to-market for releasing new business functions.
 
Integrations with other AWS services: AWS Mainframe Modernization supports AWS CloudFormation, AWS PrivateLink, and AWS Key Management Service for repeatable deployment and greater security and compliance.
 
The Automated Refactoring pattern, powered by AWS Blu Age, is focused on accelerating modernization by converting the complete legacy application stack and its data layer into a modern Java-based application while preserving functional equivalence. During this automated transformation, it creates a multi-tier application with an Angular-based front-end, an API-enabled Java backend and a data layer accessing modern data stores. The refactoring process provides equivalent functionality to the legacy stack to increase project automation resulting in speed, quality, and lower cost for achieving business benefits quicker. For more information, see AWS Mainframe Modernization Automated Refactor.
 
The Replatforming pattern, powered by Micro Focus Enterprise suite, is focused on preserving the application language, code, and artifacts in order to minimize the impact to the application assets and teams. It helps customers maintain the application knowledge and skills. While the application changes are limited, this pattern also facilitates a modernization of the infrastructure and the processes. The infrastructure is changed to a modern cloud-based managed service while the processes are changed to follow best practices for application development and IT operations. For more information, see AWS Mainframe Modernization Replatform.
 
Try it! We offer tutorials and sample applications to help you get a sense of what AWS Mainframe Modernization offers. Choose either the Tutorial: Set up managed runtime for AWS Blu Age or the Tutorial: Set up managed runtime for Micro Focus for a complete, step-by-step tutorial.
 
If you are interested in automated refactoring, check out the AWS Blu Age tools at BluInsights. You can also set up AppStream 2.0 to access the AWS Blu Age Developer IDE, or the Micro Focus Enterprise Analyzer and Micro Focus Enterprise Developer tools.
 
The tutorials and sample applications only give you a sense of what AWS Mainframe Modernization provides. When you are ready to start a modernization project, see Modernization approach for details about the stages and tasks of a modernization project.
 
Currently, you can access AWS Mainframe Modernization through the console at For a list of regions where AWS Mainframe Modernization is available, see AWS Mainframe Modernization endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
 
AWS Mainframe Modernization charges for the usage of instances supporting the managed runtime environments. In addition, AWS Mainframe Modernization offers some tools without additional charges. You are responsible for fees incurred for other AWS services that you use in connection with AWS Mainframe Modernization. AWS will provide 30 days' notice before any pricing changes take effect for use of AWS Mainframe Modernization. For more information, see Mainframe Modernization with AWS.
 
**Project Overview:** The QA tester role requires expertise in technical requirements, particularly in handling negative testing and thinking creatively to address scenarios others may overlook. **Monthly nighttime calls are needed for releases**. Adaptability to changing processes within SDLC is essential. Effective communication skills are crucial, with a focus on clear communication. Personality-wise, the ideal candidate should be assertive and not afraid to voice opinion. Familiarity with data validation tools like Jira, as well as backend technologies such as Hogan, mainframe, and wireless, is necessary. Experience with Ready API and mobile testing platforms like BrowserStack and Bitbar is advantageous. The role entails collaborating on data needs, conducting exploratory testing, and enhancing testing processes. Approximately 30% of the role involves API testing.
