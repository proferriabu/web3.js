**So what is the impact of these final orders on our library?** Broadly, this injunction will result in a significant loss of access to valuable knowledge for the public. It means that people who are not part of an elite institution or who do not live near a well-funded public library will lose access to books they cannot read otherwise. It is a sad day for the Internet Archive, our patrons, and for all libraries.

Libraries are going to have to fight to be able to buy, preserve, and lend digital books outside of the confines of temporary licensed access. We deeply appreciate your support as we continue this fight!
 
But I suspect that most of the microfilms are things like old journals that no one has digitally and never will. Which does raise the next question: are materials available on JSTOR or Proquest considered to be exempt or non-exempt from IA use?
 
What I would also find useful, on catalog entries for works still in copyright (alongside the Bibliographic data), is appropriate links either to booksellers websites (examples being Amazon, abebooks, Barnes and Nobel, Waterstones amongst others) where I can purchase the work concerned, or to (paid) subscription services that allow a copyright work to be legally purchased or viewed.
 
Really, who comes here to get a copy of any of those commercial bestsellers, of any generation? We come here for orphan works, old magazines, out-of-print books that no publisher is ever going to make available again, etc.

The injunction clarifies that the Publisher Plaintiffs will notify us of their commercially available books, and the Internet Archive will expeditiously remove them from lending.

From my understanding of the proceeding, only titles directly offered from the 4 aforementioned publishers under AAP or their own respective umbrella of outlets are included in this injunction. Nothing else.
Titles that are under AAP umbrella but not of those 4 publishers, titles that are not under AAP umbrella including those affiliated with or digitized via Amazon, Google, Audible, and the likes are not inclusive under this injunction.
 
Good. Piracy is wrong. Intellectual property rights belong to the creators and their heirs, who can choose to license some of those rights to commercial publishers, movie studios, foreign publishers, etc. What IA did was completely wrong, as the court case made conclusive.

Will the Internet Archive verify (and/or allow users to verify) that books removed under this provision continue to be available in electronic format from the publishers? Publishers might in the future delete them from electronic distribution or impose unreasonable terms so there needs to be some checks on that publishers list.
 
It is a sad day for America when everything is monetized. Many people, who are interested in varied subjects, do not have access to large libraries and repositories. IA fills a gap for many of us who do not have the means to ttravel or discretionary funds to purchase printed material for our subject of ibterest.
 
Archive.org states that they've been exempted from copyright issues( ) under the fair use doctrine and due to its educational purpose. 

They have alot of vintage stuff available, which I'm crazy about, such as having magazine copies of old software products from early issues ranging from the 1970's to early 2000's and so on. 

But I also noticed they have a collection of full-version not-for sale(except ebay, maybe) vintage games, such as abandonware(not an official term), for download. 

I was wondering, if I download any unauthorized games from that particular site, am I immune from liability for unauthorized copying infringement if I download any of those games or is it only archive.org that's exempted as a library in particiular? 

I'll be honest, I love old games and I know actual enforcement of so-called abandonware is probably not enforced, but it's still an ethics question I'm curious about. 

Thanks!

Taking into consideration that the archive.org wayback machine is very special: webpage links are not pointing to the archive itself, but to a web page that might no longer be there. JavaScript is used client-side to update the links, but a trick like a recursive wget won't work.
 
I tried different ways to download a site and finally I found the wayback machine downloader - which was built by Hartator (so all credits go to him, please), but I simply did not notice his comment to the question. To save you time, I decided to add the wayback\_machine\_downloader gem as a separate answer here.
 
Hi,
I've just come across a boatload of content containing one of my favorite news anchors, the only problem is it's on archive.org, and I can only seem to get it to play 1 minute at a time. My question is, does anyone have any pointers navigating archive.org content, videos, audio, etc. with safari and voiceover? Or better yet, is there a software that's accessible with voiceover so I can download this content? If it can't be downloaded, I'd at least like to play it more than one minute at a time so I can capture it with audiohijack and not have to babysit it and click click click it every minute. For a 30 minute recording, I'll be doing an awful lot of clicking.
I'm new at using archive.org, so also any general pointers in regards to voiceover accessibility with archive.org with safari on the mac would be great. I'm using a macbook pro with catalina, if that's any help.
 
Hi,
I'm not reading anything, these are videos of a show called Inside Washington, and also newscasts containing one of my favorite newspeople. And I'm so frustrated, because I can only watch one minute at a time!!!! :( I'll have to try it on a mobile device though, maybe I can watch that way, I might still have to click like mad, but it might be more consistent. Here's hoping, lol.
 
It feels like Christmas has come early, I downloaded Downie, and it works. Yes, I have to merge the files together, but downie lets me select all of the files in that video to download at once. And permute, (from the makers of Downie), has a file stitching feature, so it makes it easier. I know, I'm such a geek, lol.
But thank you for the recommendation of Downie.
 
For one thing, Wayback Machine pages are not something that would normally appear very high in SERPs. Oh sure, a search for site:web.archive.org will give you some 56K results in the SERPs. But you'll rarely find them ranking highly for any but the most obscure search query. And if they were, the rank would be for WM, not your site.
 
Now let's say someone does research on your site, and finds some page, and starts to click around on there. They won't be taken to your current site; they'll be clicking within the WM iframe of your old site. So let's say we hit the above Macy's page and click on a top nav menu link. We get to:
 
I have seen sites with millions of views a month have HUGE amount of pages indexed in Archive.org. There has to be some correaltion here. I would like to do a joint test with another SEO if you are up to it. Lets test out some ideas and report back. I remember when Alexa used to be a "ranking" signal back in the day. There could be some benefit. Even being listed on that site must help in some way. With that being said, I have blocked Archive from indexing some of my sites, and had no problems with indexing in the SERPS.
 
Heritrix (sometimes spelled heretrix, or misspelled or mis-said as heratrix/heritix/ heretix/heratix) is an archaic word for heiress (woman who inherits). Since our crawler seeks to collect and *preserve* the digital artifacts of our culture for the benefit of future researchers and generations, this name seemed apt.
 
(If you see a different User-Agent in your logs that still says 'heritrix', it may be someone else using this open-source software. In such a case, even if we can't directly change how your site is crawled, we are happy to help you interpret your logs and identify, contact, or block the source of any troublesome crawling.)
 
Release 3.0.0 is a major release, the first of the Heritrix3 ("H3") series. It includes new features and issue fixes, and a significant reworking of the configuration system and user interface based on current and expected needs.
 
Heritrix3 is currently suitable for advanced users and projects that are either customizing Heritrix (with Java or other scripting code) or embedding Heritrix in a larger system. Please review the Current Limitations to help determine if Heritrix3 or a current Heritrix1 (1.14.4 or later) release is best suited for your needs.
 
The next major release will be 2.2 in 2009, which is planned to include updates to the Heritrix 2 configuration system and checkpointing functionality, and tools easing transition from 1.14.x to Heritrix 2.2.
 
Release 1.14.0 adds a number of small features to the Heritrix 1.x line, most notably upgrading support for the WARC archived-web-content format to version 0
