I view the wording of hero points as they only interact with the dying condition - meaning that instant death effects aren't circumvented by having a hero point. Has yet to come up in a game for me since players are rarely put against death effects or things capable of using the massive damage rules.

For persistent damage... I've actually houseruled that hero points to avoid death also end any ongoing persistent damage effects. Because otherwise persistent damage is ridiculously dangerous, and players in my group really didn't like the feeling of using hero points to remove the dying condition and then immediately going back to dying because of the persistent damage.
 
But I know some GMs (and arguably strictest RAW here) only allow it to interact with dying so no hero points out of death effects and persistent damage will just tick that dying condition back up every round.
 
I agree that ongoing damage is ridiculously scary, but I see it as a good thing. Really spurs the party into action trying to save their comrades. There's nothing quite as exhilarating as those nail-biting edge-of-your-seat moments.
 
Likely because damage is dealt after the result of the saving throw. You no loner have the ability to reroll the saving throw.

Likely because damage is dealt after the result of the saving throw. You no loner have the ability to reroll the saving throw. Sure, but I mean, it's not like many GMs bother to ask between those steps. Most in my experience just immediately announce the results the moment they hear the save result.**PC:** "I got 17 on the save."

Yeah, an interesting quirk I discovered mid-encounter was that if a Death tagged spell deals enough damage to drop a player to 0, they still just die. Phantasmal killer can kill a PC outright even if they manage to hero point the saving throw, because anything less than a critical success on the save deals damage. My player and I were both caught by surprise by his sudden demise.
 
The death trait skips right over the dying condition and puts you straight to dead. Sort of one of the benefits of spells and abilities with the death trait. As a counterpoint, no?The rules never actually say you can only avoid death when you would die from Dying.
 
I also highly recommend people do not approach PF2 with the idea that some text is intended purely for flavor and other text for mechanics. If that was a design intent, you separate those two types of text more clearly than by butting them together in the same paragraphs or sentences. The intention of PF2 is the description of what happens with an ability is supposed to help guide the table in interpreting it mechanically.
 
If what you mean to say is "it's unclear" then we are in agreement.I'm not trying to argue the rules must be interpreted my way, just that I find there is cause for contemplation before declaring the rules "obviously" disallow you to use Hero Points to save yourself from death effects...
 
But more importantly, why are you putting the burden of evidence on me? By your own dog basketball reasoning(?) why wait for concrete rules that might never materialize because the rule is already there, loud and clear:

It is probably best a topic for GMs to discuss with their players and take into consideration the tone of the campaign. Even if it is clarified in Errata one way or another, no one would be doing it wrong to make it apply only to dying condition situations in a gritty game or to all death situations in a pulpier game.
 
The primary value in getting clarification from a design perspective is to figure out how murderously terrifying creatures and situations with one off death trait effects and the ability to do massive damage should be.

I definitely think this is a high-priority case to put on Paizo's radar, yep.

Both Unicore and Zapp are noting that if we removed the mechanical portion of the rules ("You can do this when your dying condition would increase. You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points.") you're left with "Spend a Hero Point to avoid death." But that doesn't clarify anything. You aren't cutting away extraneous information, but rather keeping only the extraneous.
 
Hero Point rules state that they can do two things: reroll and avoid death. They are then clarified mechanically what they mean. Without that explanation, "avoid death" is so ambiguous in a mechanical sense as to be entirely worthless. Can I avoid dying of old age? Can I not drown? Can I survive the vacuum of space? Can I ingest lava?
 
I believe it's fully within the realm of possibility for a GM to allow players to use Hero Points to not die from death effects. As a matter of fact, I encourage that at tables just as much as I encourage GMs allowing a player who is having an unlucky night get a free reroll, no Hero Points needed. However, while you may see the wording as ambiguous, without the context for how the ability actually operates, it creates more problems then is solves by RAW.
 
I disagree with you, Ruzza. Rules can't explain everything. Using Hero Points to avoid death is enough. You know the intent, it's your charge as a GM to handle it. It doesn't have to be explained clearly.
 
It was my (quite decent front liner with expert Fortitude saves) character dying that prompted Andrews post in that thread that caused James to realize how broken the monster that James had used actually was.
 
And my GM made it very, very, very apparent to me that failing the save was NOT a good idea. I took the hint and used my hero point. Needing to roll a 13 on the dice not too surprisingly I still failed :-(.
 
I'd have been seriously irked if the GM had NOT strongly hinted to me that it was REALLY important to make that save. Some level of meta is definitely warranted when it is quite literally Save or Die.
 
This section appears to be more clear in establishing only two circumstances in which you can use the ability, either when your turn starts or when your dying condition increases. Since death effects ignore the dying condition and generally aren't a part of your turn starting - you never get a chance to use hero points in that instance (unless you can reroll a saving throw).

The key is it explains exactly how to do it afterward. Yes, technically it could've just read you "avoid death" and GMs would have to figure it out, but Paizo would've been foolish to have that be the full explanation, and it would entirely break the format they use for the rest of the rulebook.
 
The book tells you what you can do with an ability. Not everything you can't do. Besides, if the following sentences were an example and not an explanation, there's a really nice phrase that they could've put in. Namely: "for example", "such as", and so on.
 
P.S. I pulled up the core rulebook PDF and searched for the first reference to "you can do this", and this is what I found on page 72 under the Alchemy class feature of alchemists:
"You understand the complex interactions of natural and unnatural substances and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use special infused reagents that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost..."
 
So, if the hero point text is unclear, then so is the above, and I should be able to "concoct alchemical items to meet [my] needs." Any reference to what it says about the details of how this can be done are now irrelevant, because it doesn't say that I *can't
