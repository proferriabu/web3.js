It has the annoying line format and I want to go back to the regular word format. I have reinstalled office and tried various other format settings but nothing has worked. Any suggestions?

The Cite While You Write plugin allows communication between EndNote and Microsoft Word. Download the Cite While You Write plugin from **myendnoteweb.com > Downloads**. EndNote commands will appear in Word once the plugin is installed.
 
I tried deleting the plugin file from Mac HD / Library / Application Support / Endnote, but it did not convert the endnotes in my Pages document to plain text, which is what I need. Thanks for any help you can give!
 
Actually, I am not trying to uninstall EndNote itself, but the plugin that allows EndNote to integrate with Pages. (The integration is pretty awful so I am trying to uninstall it once I have all my citations complete so I can make some manual edits of my footnotes and bibliography.) I tried to delete the plugin file from Mac HD but that didn't actually convert the citations to plain text, so I am currently thinking I'll have to manually copy and paste my footnotes into MS Word and back to make them editable... which is pretty absurd. I'd welcome advice or any other ideas.

While we would like to help, EndNote is not developed by Apple, so we don't have the resources to answer this question. You would want to reach out to the developer using the link we shared in our previous message. They will be able to assist with you EndNote.
 
EndNote is a reference manager that is both desktop and web-based and can be used on Windows and Mac computers. Members of the University of Oxford can use the desktop version of EndNote for free while they are at the University. EndNote can be installed on personal computers, is available on Bodleian Libraries reading room PCs and can be installed on office computers in the University. See the 'Install' section of this page for further details.
 
If you already use EndNote and its Online Search feature to search the University of Oxford's collections, you may have had trouble conducting searches. This is because our settings have changed. You will need to download and install the new Connections file. Follow instructions on the IT Services website.
 
EndNote can be used as a desktop or web-based application. The desktop version of EndNote has more features and is free for University of Oxford members to use while they are members of the institution. We would recommend using the desktop version of EndNote.
 
EndNote Online is free regardless of whether somebody is at an institution and can be set up to sync with your desktop version of EndNote, making your library of references accessible from any computer with an internet connection.
 
To cite the references in your EndNote library, you need to use a word processor plugin. A plugin is available for Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Apache OpenOffice, LibreOffice, Pages and Wolfram Mathematica 8.
 
The desktop version of EndNote can be installed on up to three personal computers for free via the University's IT Services website below. The current version is EndNote 21 but the previous version (20) is still available on the website.
 
You can sync it with your desktop-based EndNote library, making your references available from any computer with an internet connection, and you use it to sync your desktop library across multiple computers.
 
You need to make sure you already have Word installed on your machine before installing EndNote. The Cite While You Write plugin will not appear if you install Word after EndNote. If you need to retrospectively add Cite While You Write to Word, follow the instructions at the web page below:
 
Note, there is no word processor plugin for iPads or iPhones. You can either copy and paste references from your iOS app into your document, or you will need to use the Cite While You Write plugin on a desktop computer or laptop.
 
The University's IT Learning Centre also runs workshops on EndNote. To see dates and booking details, go to their Digital Skills web page and enter **Endnote** in **Course search**:

If you install the MS Word plugin, you will be able to take advantage of the cite-while-you-write (CWYW) features using your EndNote Online library. Otherwise, you can export a list of reference in a selected bibliographic style and paste them into your document.
 
Note that from the EndNote tab in Word you will be able to select whether you wish to use your Online Library or a library from the desktop version of EndNote if you are using that as well. From the tab go to **preferences** then select the **application**tab from the pop-up window in order to choose which version of EndNote you wish to connect to that particular Word document.
 
If you use a word processor that isn't Microsoft Word, you can export a list of references with your preferred citation style applied, but you won't get the tight integration between EndNote and the word processor that you would have with Word.
