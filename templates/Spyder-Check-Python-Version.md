You can launch the correct version of Spyder by launching from Ananconda's Navigator. From the dropdown, switch to your desired environment and then press the launch Spyder button. You should be able to check the results right away.

When you use pip install, the next thing on the command line should be the name of the package you are trying to install. You cannot install Python from Pip. The purpose of Pip is to set up third-party packages, within a Python installation that already exists. You already have one of them here. In your command prompt, where it says (win-64\_python-3.8.10-h7840368\_2\_cpython), that is showing you the name of the currently active virtual environment - a folder that contains a copy of Python taken from some base install.
 
**Step by step**, exactly what have you done since then in order to install, upgrade or downgrade new versions of related software? For example, did you get a stand-alone installer for Spyder? What came first?
 
To create a new Python environment with the Python version and packages you want, follow the steps in this FAQ question (which I recently revised to be simpler and easier to understand, and also has a dedicated video tutorial), making sure to add python=3.8 (or, better, 3.11, or whatever version you want) at end of the command beginning conda create, e.g.:
 
Spyder 4.2.5 is nearly 3 years old and Spyder 4 is long-unsupported; the current release is Spyder 5.5.0, while the first stable release of Spyder 6 just around the corner. There have been many improvements in recent versions to the functionality for connecting and using Spyder with different environments, so you should always use the latest version.
 
Yup, this is correct. In your screenshot of the Spyder statusbar, the version of Spyder is shown to the left (as well as whether any updates are available), while the current default working environment name, type and its Python version are shown to the right. You can right-click on the latter (or the "Completions entry to its right, if shown) to open the preferences pane to select a different one. As mentioned, out of the box Spyder defaults to opening new consoles in its own runtime environment, which in this case is the internal environment created by the installer.

Depending on your Python distribution, you may get more information in the result set. However, the number next to Python is the version number, which is what we are looking for. In this case, the full version number is 3.8.3.
 
Sometimes you may want to check the version of Python when you are coding an application (i.e. inside the script). This is especially useful when you have multiple Python versions installed on your computer. To check which Python version is running, you can use either the sys or the platform module. The script will be the same for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
 
Both code snippets output the Python version in the **string** format. If necessary, you can also get the version number in the **tuple** format. The tuple will contain five components: major, minor, micro, release level, and serial:
 
Thanks for the help, Crystal. I did go back to version 4.2.5 just as you suggested and now spyder is working OK. Unfortunately, I am now having a problem with updating anaconda-navigator. Here is my (base) prompt message:
 
I am new to using python with ArcPro and have had some problems using the Spyder IDE. I could not install the most recent version of Spyder AND the version I could install (5.1.5) has a bunch of glitches. Most importantly, the debugger function does not seem to work. I don't need or want anything with too many bells and whistles, and I'm still learning about how to install packages and work with environments. What suggestions do folks have for a Python IDE that reliably works with ArcPro and doesn't require any complicated maneuvering to ensure compatibility?
 
However, a "pip" install works to get spyder going with the latest version since it really doesn't care about the arcpy/arcgis issues, you may not have a bug free experience with Pro or its notebook functionality, but that depends on what you do with Pro
 
Ugh. I am so frustrated. I think I'm ready to just de-install Spyder with ArcPro and reinstall it with Anaconda. Is there a good guide somewhere about how to use Spyder with ArcPro once I get it loaded with anaconda? Everything I'm reading is loaded down with SOOOOO much jargon.
 
So I've similarly been messing with this this week. I got a fresh install of ArcPro 3.0.1 on my machine and cloned the default env through package manager, activated my clone, restarted Arc, then downloaded spyder 5.1.5 through package manager to my clone env successfully. I open spyder through my clone env / scripts and then spyder opens and I made sure it is also set to my clone env here.
 
I go to the console and 'import arcpy' but get the attached messages despite seeing that Arcpy is in my clone env and that spyder is set to my clone env. Feeling at a loss with this. Would love to hear input on why arcpy will not work with spyder.
 
All I did was install SPyder 5.1.5 to my clone with the ArcPro package manager. Then I followed the suggestions in the attached post to create a desktop shortcut as Dan suggests below. It imports arcpy and I can use all those tools fine. There are just issues with some other random things. Here's a link to the instructions I followed: -pro-blog/installing-spyder-ide-for-arcpro/ba-p/901923
 
Try a shortcut on your desktop. You need to execute the spyder-script.py script using python in your clone. YHou still can't update beyond 5.1.5 because of things pinned and a convoluted dependency path which is being impeded somewhere along the trail.
 
Spyder 5.2.1 is working now on my windows machine that has Arcpro 3.0.1 installed. I did a slightly different workflow, not sure if will break things down the line but I've tested it out on several of my arcpy dependent py scripts without any issues so far.
 
Spyder is a free and open source scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts.It features a unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization capabilities of a scientific package.
 
Want to join the community of scientists, engineers and analysts all around the world using Spyder?Click the button below to download the suggested installer for your platform.We offer standalone installers on Windows and macOS, and as our Linux installer is are still experimental, we currently recommend the cross-platform Anaconda distribution for that operating system, which includes Spyder and many other useful packages for scientific Python.You can also try out Spyder right in your web browser by launching it on Binder.
 
The built-in interpreter of the standalone version doesn't currently support installing packages beyond the common scientific libraries bundled with it, so most users will want to have an external Python environment to run their own code, like with any other IDE.Also, the standalone installers don't yet work with third-party plugins, so users needing them should use Spyder through a Conda-based distribution instead.For a detailed guide to this and the other different ways to obtain Spyder, refer to our full installation instructions, and check out our release page for links to all our installers.Happy Spydering!
 
Install the version of scikit-learn provided by youroperating system or Python distribution.This is a quick option for those who have operating systems or Pythondistributions that distribute scikit-learn.It might not provide the latest release version.
 
If you have not installed NumPy or SciPy yet, you can also install these usingconda or pip. When using pip, please ensure that binary wheels are used,and NumPy and SciPy are not recompiled from source, which can happen when usingparticular configurations of operating system and hardware (such as Linux ona Raspberry Pi).
 
Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions starting with plot\_and classes ending with Display) require Matplotlib. The examples requireMatplotlib and some examples require scikit-image, pandas, or seaborn. Theminimum version of scikit-learn dependencies are listed below along with itspurpose.
 
The Debian/Ubuntu package is split in three different packages calledpython3-sklearn (python modules), python3-sklearn-lib (low-levelimplementations and bindings), python3-sklearn-doc (documentation).Note that scikit-learn requires Python 3, hence the need to use the python3-suffixed package names.Packages can be installed using apt-get:
 
Compatibility with the standard scikit-learn solvers is checked by running thefull scikit-learn test suite via automated continuous integration as reportedon intel/scikit-learn-intelex. If you observe any issuewith scikit-learn-intelex, please report the issue on theirissue tracker.
 
It can happen that pip fails to install packages when reaching the default pathsize limit of Windows if Python is installed in a nested location such as theAppData folder structure under the user home directory, for instance:
 
Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python and R programming languages for scientific computing. It simplifies package management and deployment, making it easier for data scientists to manage their projects and dependencies.
 
**Command Not Working**: If the conda list anaconda$ command does not return the Anaconda version, try updating Conda by typing conda update conda in the Anaconda Prompt and then retry the command.
 
Knowing your Python Anaconda version is essential for compatibili
