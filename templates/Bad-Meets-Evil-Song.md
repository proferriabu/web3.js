I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts. You know, there's a story behind that there saloon. 20 years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over. Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em. (spits) Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen. Got murdered in cold blood. That old saloon there was their little "home away from home". They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern, and on a quiet night, you can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9".

**[Verse 1]**
[Eminem]
I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph and a noise is bred,
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head
Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoisted his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said...

 
[Royce]
Too hard; yo, I done heard worse!
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other to see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic
Whose mental capacity holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil
Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked
It's like the Nazis and the Nations collaborating attempting to take over the Earth

 
[Royce]
The disaster with dreads
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny
Actually, my flavor's similar to a waiter, 'cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slipping bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it
Murder you, then come to your funeral service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazing MCs, at the same time amazing MCs
Somehow, MCs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me
From all of angles of us, flash a Mack loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt


[Eminem (and Royce)]
I used to be a loudmouth
Remember me? (Uh-uh) I'm the one who burned your house down (Oh)
But I'm out now (Shit!)And this time I'm coming back to blow your house up,And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of!
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm getting ready to leave
I'mma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

 
**[Outro]**
And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil, two of the most wanted individuals in the county. Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens. It's too bad they had to go out the way they did: got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon. But their spirits still live on till this day... Shhh...[spits] wait, did y'all hear that?
