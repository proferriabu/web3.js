**GTA 5 cheats** and the corresponding **GTA 5 cheat codes** are a staple of any GTA plathrough at this point, being the easiest way to get straight to the fun - which most of the time means straight to the invincibility, weapons, ammo and of course helicopters.
 
For a full list of all GTA 5 cheats, console commands, and phone numbers, then, you've come to the right page. Do note that for money, however, it's confirmed that there's absolutely no specific GTA 5 money cheat - but there are some alternatives. If that's what you're after, we have a guide on how to make money in GTA 5 that'll have you rolling with the elite in no time!
 
GTA 5 added some interesting ways to input cheats on top of the good old controller button-mashing codes. On consoles, you can input those controller codes or, alternatively, whip out the in-game cell phone to dial in a number that activates the cheat instead.
 
On PC, you can do either of those things and also use console commands - the commands are actually the words spelled out by the phone numbers, which is a nice touch (giving you things like 1-999-LAWYERUP)!

There is a decent range of cheats available for GTA 5 players, but it's worth noting that some classics are missing - there's no way to spawn yourself a tank for instance, plus no actual, official money cheat - despite what a lot of people will tell you!
 
Otherwise, there are a couple of final things to bear in mind: first, you won't be able to unlock achievements or trophies, or get anything other than a Bronze rating on missions, in a session where cheats have been activated. Second, all of these cheats are purely offline only - cheats are disabled in GTA Online, due to the pretty obvious disrupted effect they'd otherwise have!
 
Xbox Series X/S, Xbox 360 and Xbox One GTA cheats work in the same way as they do on PlayStation platforms: you can enter them at any point in offline mode by using the controller inputs listed below, or by dialling the cell phone numbers listed next to them.
 
The only thing to note is that the buttons don't always line up exactly with their counterparts on PlayStation - so just because you have, say, the Invincibility cheat burned into your muscle memory on one platform, that doesn't mean it's the exact same buttons on the other. Double check the list below when in doubt!
 
You can also use the cell phone numbers - listed in the tables below alongside the cheat codes - to enter the same cheats if you prefer. To do so, simply bring up your phone and dial the number listed next to the cheat you're after.
 
As we mentioned above, cheats on PCs work a little differently to their counterparts on consoles. You can still use a controller to input them - we've used Xbox button names below, as that's the most popular choice of PC gamepad - but otherwise the main ways of inputting them are via the in-game cell phone (again, bring it up in-game and dial the below numbers to use the cheats), or alternatively you can use console commands.
 
Instead, you have to put in the work yourself - and thankfully, we can help with our GTA 5 stock market explainer, which offers a step-by-step breakdown of how you can use stock market assassinations to boost your capital.
 
GTA 5 or Grand Theft Auto 5 is a popular game that came out way back in 2013. Despite being that old, GTA 5 has a massive player base across multiple platforms. Just like other GTA titles, GTA 5 lets you use cheats to unlock god-like powers. There is a whole list of GTA 5 cheat codes available to enhance your gameplay experience and create havoc. You can experience the fun-filled action game on platforms like PC, PS5, PS4, PS3, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Xbox 360. In this article, we will take a look at **GTA 5 cheats for PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox consoles**, and how to use them.
 
PlayStation users can also use cheat codes to enhance their gaming experience. The following new GTA 5 cheats for PS4, PS5, and PS3 remain consistent across consoles and can be activated using the controllers.
 
GTA 5 gives your character the chance to make a girlfriend in the game. You have to head over to a strip club and ask for a stripper to a private dance. Then, flirt with the stripper to increase your Like meter. Avoid the bouncer catching you flirting, will be thrown out. When the Like meter is full, the stripper will ask you to meet outside. Select Go Home and wait for her outside the strip club. Get in the car and follow the given route. Hang out at her place, to add her contact number to your phone. Use the number to call and see her again
 
Unfortunately, GTA 5 cheats do not let you win money. Gamers have to complete missions, robbery to earn the in-game currency that shows up in the tab. However, you can use GTA Online Shark Card to buy in-game cash that can be used by your GTA 5 character.
 
Once you have these two cheats turned on, head into the Buy menu, and search for**Debug**in the catalog. Scroll through all the debug items here, and you'll eventually find several different cars that you can place on your lot!
 
You can also upsize the toy cars, trucks, planes, etc. in Decorations by using the right bracket key. It's faster and easier than hunting them down in debug. They might drop back to their original size again if you upload the lot to you library or the gallery though. But they'll hold the size you set in your game.
 
As @PipMenace said, it's a keyboard key with the parenthesis keys (   ) on the right side of the keyboard. The right ( ] ) and left ( ] )bracket keys are shortcuts to resize many objects in the game. The left makes thing smaller and the right makes them bigger. I'm not sure how typing commands in the game works for the consoles as I play on a PC, but if you get a popup keyboard to do that, they should still be in the same relative position.
 
Cobra CarDefinitiveHDOriginalUnit informationIntroduced in *Age of Empires II*TypeSiege unitTrainingTrained at Town CenterCheat codehow do you turn this onStatistics Hit points500 Melee attack10Attack bonus+10 vs Building Blast radius[What?] Reload time0.25Attack delay0 Range10Accuracy100%Projectile speed5.5 Melee armor10 Pierce armor10Armor classSiege weapon (+50) Speed4.5Line of Sight12The **Cobra Car** (formerly known as **Shelby Cobra**, simply titled **COBRA** in the original game) is a cheat unit in *Age of Empires II*. It is an AC Cobra that fires rounds of bullets at its targets. It is also available in the Scenario Editor.
 
Rather than utilizing explosive weapons in combat like its predecessor, the Cobra behaves much like a very rapidly-firing Hand Cannoneer. However, the Cobra has a tendency to harm friendly units caught within its blast radius.
 
The Cobra has a very impressive range of 10 that can hardly be matched by any other ranged attacker in the game, allowing it to pummel incoming hostiles with ease, though Towers, Castles or British Longbowmen can outrange it. Still, due to its high hit points, armor, and damage output, the Cobra Car easily mows down armies of Longbowmen.
 
A fatal weakness of Cobras is their poor AI, relying heavily on proper and constant micromanagement in order to protect them from damage and destruction during a raid, not from the enemy but from themselves. For some reason, shots fired from the Cobras can deal high damage towards friendlies who wander into their line of fire (including other Cobras). Because of this, clusters of these cars huddling up trying to tear down a fortified structure such as a Castle or Wonder can accidentally fire over and destroy each other's very quickly.
 
Due to the Cobra Car being classified as a siege weapon, all technologies and civilization bonuses that enhance all Siege Workshop units also benefits this unit. However, despite being also a gunpowder unit, it is not affected by unique technologies and civilization bonuses that benefit gunpowder units.
 
It may be hard to believe, but 2024 is the 20th anniversary of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, a game that revolutionised the video game space back in October 2004. The love for the open world action-adventure from Rockstar has only grown over time, and a big part of that is down to its cheats.
 
If you want to blast through the story with ease or just have some fun in the open world of Los Santos, then you will need all the relevant cheats. Whether it be for a rocket launcher, helicopter or infinite health, we have everything covered.
 
A workaround involves using a third-party app like Hacker's Keyboard if you do not want to fork out on a physical keyboard that connects to your phone. Once you get a keyboard working with your phone or tablet, the GTA San Andreas cheat codes for iOS and Android should be the same as the PC ones listed below.
 
With all of those GTA San Andreas cheat codes to enjoy, there's no excuse not to have fun when you boot up the GTA Trilogy remaster on your computer or console of choice. Now what are you waiting for?
