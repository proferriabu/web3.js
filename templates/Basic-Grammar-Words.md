Conjunctions are words that allow us to connect our thoughts together. For example, the words eand Slow audio Play audio Conjunction , masbut Slow audio Play audio Conjunction , and ouor Slow audio Play audio Conjunction represent different relationships between what comes before and after the conjunction. Here is the first conjunctions-related unit: Coordinating Conjunctions
 
The easiest way to make a statement negative is by adding the word nono, not Slow audio Play audio Adverb before the verb. For example, Eu gosto de cafI like coffee Slow audio Play audio becomes Eu **no** gosto de cafI don't like coffee .  
Double negatives are also acceptable in Portuguese. For example, Eu **no** comi **nada**I did **not** eat **anything** is perfectly grammatical, even though the literal translation would be something like I did **not** eat **nothing**.
 
When you answer a question in Portuguese, you typically want to include the verb, rather than just saying SimYes Slow audio Play audio Adverb or NoNo Slow audio Play audio Adverb . For example, you could respond to the question above by saying:
 
Open-ended questions are more complicated, but in many cases the word order is quite similar to English. You can learn more about asking and answering questions in Portuguese here: Portuguese Questions.
 
Clitic pronouns are basically like mini words that can replace the direct and/or indirect **object**. You may have noticed them next to verbs here and there:  
D-**lhe** uma caneta, por favorGive **her** a pen, please Slow audio Play audio Ele levantou-**se** cedo hojeHe got up early today Slow audio Play audio Posso ajud-**lo**?Can I help **you**? (sing.,formal,masc.) Slow audio Play audio   
Clitics provide information about the gender and number of the direct object, indirect object, or, in the case of reflexive verbs, the person/thing doing the action. The rules can be confusing, but they are quite common, so at least being familiar with clitic pronouns is an important part of understanding basic Portuguese grammar.

The default position for a clitic pronoun is **after** the verb, as in Chamo**-me** JoelMy name is Joel Slow audio Play audio , i.e. I call **myself** Joel.  
There are **many** exceptions, though. For example, following the word no and in most open-ended questions, the clitic pronoun comes **before** the verb, as in: No **me** lembroI don't remember and Como **te** chamas?What's **your**(sing.,inf.) name? Slow audio Play audio
 
Inverse order is not just for questions, though. There are other reasons someone may decide to use inverse order, which depend heavily on context. Adjusting the word order may serve to **emphasize** a certain element of the sentence, for example. There are not always strict rules for this, so understanding Portuguese word order will come more easily with time and exposure to the language.
 
This is very concise and extremely helpful. I am trying to learn Portuguese via Duolingo and Babbel. While Babbel is a little better, neither is good at explaining the grammar. Thank you for explaining it so well.
 
The first thing you need to learn to build sentences in French is the word order. Otherwise, even if you learn a lot of vocabulary, it will always be difficult to identify the keywords and the general meaning of what you hear or read.

It's not easy. Words and phrases that sound fine in your head can look like gibberish when written down -- that is, if you even realize you made a mistake in the first place. It's easy for little grammar mistakes to slip by, especially when you're self-editing.
 
Well, you can start by reading through this post to see which common grammar mistakes resonate with you the most. (It's okay -- we're all guilty of at least one.) Make a mental note to avoid that mistake in the future, or heck, just bookmark this page to remind yourself of them over and over (and over) again. You can also utilize the best grammar checker tools that can help spot and prevent these common mistakes!
 
One's a contraction for "they are" (they're), one refers to something owned by a group (their), and one refers to a place (there). You know the difference among the three -- just make sure you triple check that you're using the right ones in the right places at the right times.
 
I find it's helpful to search through my posts (try control + F on PC or command + F on Mac) for those words and check that they're being used in the right context. Here's the correct usage of "they're," "there," and "their":
 
This one tends to confuse even the best of writers. "Its" is possessive and "it's" is a contraction of "it is." Lots of people get tripped up because "it's" has an 's after it, which normally means something is possessive. But in this case, it's actually a contraction.
 
When you're asserting that something should be compared to something else, make sure you always clarify what that something else is. Otherwise, it's impossible for your readers to discern what the comparison actually means.
 
If you have a sentence with an object in it -- basically a noun that receives the action -- passive voice can happen to you. Passive happens when the object of a sentence is put at the beginning of a sentence instead of at the end. With passive voice, your writing comes across as sounding weak and unclear.
 
There's way too much passive voice. See how the sentence doesn't have a subject that's acting upon the object? The object is mysteriously being "put at the beginning," making the sentence sound vague and clunky.
 
Passive voice happens when you have an object (a noun that receives the action) as the subject of a sentence. Normally, the object of the sentence appears at the end, following a verb. Passive writing isn't as clear as active writing -- your readers will thank you for your attention to detail later.
 
Make sense? It's kind of a complicated thing to describe, but active voice makes your writing seem more alive and clear. Want to get into the nitty-gritty of avoiding passive voice? Check out this tip from Grammar Girl.
 
I love the name of this mistake -- it makes me think of a dramatic, life-or-death situation such as hanging precariously off a cliff. (Of course grammar mistakes are never that drastic, but it helps me remember to keep them out of my writing.)
 
What exactly is declining for months? Jean? In reality, the sentence was trying to say that the ROI was declining -- not Jean. To fix this problem, try flipping around the sentence structure (though beware of passive voice):
 
The confusion is understandable. In English, we don't identify a brand or an entity as "he" or "she" -- so "they" seems to make more sense. But as the professor pointed out, it's just not accurate. A brand or an entity is "it."
 
Try taking Bill out of that sentence -- it sounds weird, right? You would never ask someone to send something to "I" when he or she is done. The reason it sounds weird is because "I" is the object of that sentence -- and "I" should not be used in objects. In that situation, you'd use "me."
 
You might have noticed that there's some interesting comma usage where the word "too" is involved. We'll cover commas a bit more later, but when you're using the word "too" to replace "also" or "as well," the general rule is to use a comma both before and after. The only exception occurs when "too" is the last word in the sentence -- then, follow it with a period.
 
Unfortunately, it's AP Style, so we just have to live with it. It's a hot angle for content formats, so I wouldn't shy away from using it. But when you're checking your writing for grammatical errors, just remember that the apostrophes should be in different places.
 
Note: There are different schools of thought about how to punctuate this one depending on what style guide/usage book you're using. The Chicago Manual of Style, for instance, recommends "dos" and "don'ts." The important thing is to be consistent and stick to one style guide, whether it's AP Style, Chicago, or your own house style guide.
 
Many people use the terms interchangeably when trying to elaborate on a point, but each one means something different: "i.e." roughly means "that is" or "in other words," while "e.g." means "example given" or "for example." The former is used to clarify something you've said, while the latter adds color to a story through an example.
 
This one is tricky. These two words can be used when you're describing someone or something through a phrase like, "Lindsay is a blogger who likes ice cream." When you're describing a person, be sure to use "who."
 
When you're describing an object, use "that." For example, you should say, "Her computer is the one that overheats all the time." It's pretty simple, but definitely something that gets overlooked frequently.
 
"Whom" is a little trickier. It's usually used to
