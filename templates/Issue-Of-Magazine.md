For orders in the USA, we ship by Media Mail from North Carolina, so please allow sufficient time for delivery, especially if youï¿½re on the West Coast.

Please note that US subscription copies are sent by Standard Mail unless youï¿½ve requested the more expensive "First Class" option, and can take from a few days to two weeks or more, depending on the speed of mail delivery in your area. Since we have no control over the US Postal Serviceï¿½s delivery speed, if getting your magazine before it appears in stores is critical to you, we suggest you select our "First Class" option, or purchase our magazines at your local comics shop.

For international orders, First Class Mail International (only available for packages weighing up to 4 lbs.) usually takes 2-4 weeks. Priority Mail International usually takes 1-2 weeks. Flat Rate shipping usually takes 6-8 weeks (it goes by "Surface" and the minimum charge is for 11 lbs., making it economical only for larger orders). For packages of 4 lbs. or less, the "First Class Mail International" option will generally cost less, and have faster delivery. If you want a larger package (over 4 lbs.) in the quickest time possible, your only option is the more expensive "Priority Mail International".

NOTE FOR PRIORITY MAIL CUSTOMERS: If your order contains a combination of items that are currently shipping, and upcoming items (i.e. ones that arenï¿½t shipping yet), and you choose Priority Mail (or Priority Mail International) as your shipping option, we will send the currently shipping items by Priority Mail, then send the upcoming items by the least expensive way possible as they become available. If you want the upcoming items to also ship by Priority Mail, youï¿½ll need to put each upcoming item on a separate order, so our web store can calculate the additional Priority Mail shipping costs for them.

The PLY Summer issue is brimming with these and more invaluable insights. It has a wealth of informative articles ranging from scouring to dyeing to drafting to how and why to measure your yarns to the best ply structure for socks to how to choose the exact right yarn for your project.
 
Hello! If you have found your way to this little corner of the internet, I take it that you are at least somewhat interested in learning how to spin yarn. Well, new friend, you have come to the right place!
 
**This is the only magazine that I use and keep like a book**. When it arrives, I drop everything and read PLY cover to cover. I indulge in all of the well-written content, beautiful photography, as well as the pertinent topics, discussions, instruction, patterns, tips, thought-provoking articles and product reviews. I look carefully at all of the ads as well for new tools and fiber sources! As a spinner and fiber artist, PLY is an invaluable resource that I refer back to often when dreaming up new projects. Thank you PLY for playing a vital role in my fiber arts journey!

I regularly find myself in areas without mobile data (I know, hard to believe) and like to have locally stored reading material available to pass the time. Being able to see an entire issue on one-page would allow me to print-to-pdf it ahead of time and then do the quiz when I am back online.
 
The resilience of settler privilege is a barrier. Gestures toward allyship can quickly recolonize Indigenous peoples. Some people have tried to create bonds of allyship by believing that Indigenous wisdom and spirituality are so profound that Indigenous people have always lived in ecological harmony. This is the romantic approach. Other allies have tried to create solidarity through claiming that Indigenous and non-Indigenous environmentalists should not distinguish their efforts. In this view, environmental issues threaten us all, and we should converge around common problems that affect all humanity, instead of wasting dwindling time on environmental racism. This is the same-boat approach.
 
A decolonizing approach to allyship must challenge the resilience of settler privilege, which involves directly facing the very different ecological realities we all dwell in. Sometimes I see settler environmental movements as seeking to avoid some dystopian environmental future or planetary apocalypse. These visions are replete with species extinctions, irreversible loss of ecosystems, and severe rationing. They can include abusive corporations and governments that engage in violent brainwashing, quarantining, and territorial dispossession of people who stand in their way.
 
Perhaps these goals and values are among the greatest gifts of Indigenous spirituality and wisdom. I want to experience the solidarity of allied actions that refuse fantastical narratives of commonality and hope. Determining what exactly needs to be done will involve the kind of creativity that Indigenous peoples have used to survive some of the most oppressive forms of capitalist, industrial, and colonial domination. But above all, it will require that allies take responsibility and confront the assumptions behind their actions and aspirations.
