For the handful of times I've used it so far it is fabulous and worth the value for my time. There was an issue with getting it registered but customer service was very helpful in completing that process.

I love having a mop that I can conveniently use whenever I have a small area or room I need to clean, instead of having to lug a mop and bucket all over the house. It cleans my tile floors well, and it cleans the roller while running. One thing that could be better is the indicators are a bit small and difficult to read.
 
Cleaning actions are registered to run after the cleaner is notified that the object has become phantom reachable. The cleaner uses PhantomReference and ReferenceQueue to be notified when the reachability changes.
 
Each cleaner operates independently, managing the pending cleaning actions and handling threading and termination when the cleaner is no longer in use. Registering an object reference and corresponding cleaning action returns a Cleanable. The most efficient use is to explicitly invoke the clean method when the object is closed or no longer needed. The cleaning action is a Runnable to be invoked at most once when the object has become phantom reachable unless it has already been explicitly cleaned. Note that the cleaning action must not refer to the object being registered. If so, the object will not become phantom reachable and the cleaning action will not be invoked automatically.
 
The execution of the cleaning action is performed by a thread associated with the cleaner. All exceptions thrown by the cleaning action are ignored. The cleaner and other cleaning actions are not affected by exceptions in a cleaning action. The thread runs until all registered cleaning actions have completed and the cleaner itself is reclaimed by the garbage collector.
 
If the CleaningExample is used in a try-finally block then the close method calls the cleaning action. If the close method is not called, the cleaning action is called by the Cleaner when the CleaningExample instance has become phantom reachable. public class CleaningExample implements AutoCloseable  // A cleaner, preferably one shared within a library private static final Cleaner cleaner = ; static class State implements Runnable  State(...)  // initialize State needed for cleaning action  public void run()  // cleanup action accessing State, executed at most once   private final State; private final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable public CleaningExample()  this.state = new State(...); this.cleanable = cleaner.register(this, state);  public void close()  cleanable.clean();   The cleaning action could be a lambda but all too easily will capture the object reference, by referring to fields of the object being cleaned, preventing the object from becoming phantom reachable. Using a static nested class, as above, will avoid accidentally retaining the object reference.
 
Cleaning actions should be prepared to be invoked concurrently with other cleaning actions. Typically the cleaning actions should be very quick to execute and not block. If the cleaning action blocks, it may delay processing other cleaning actions registered to the same cleaner. All cleaning actions registered to a cleaner should be mutually compatible.
 
The cleaner creates a daemon thread to process the phantom reachable objects and to invoke cleaning actions. The context class loader of the thread is set to the system class loader. The thread has no permissions, enforced only if a SecurityManager is set.
 
A thread from the thread factory's newThread method is set to be a daemon thread and started to process phantom reachable objects and invoke cleaning actions. On each call the thread factory must provide a Thread that is suitable for performing the cleaning actions.
 
Not all air-cleaning devices are appropriate for home use; some are known to be harmful to human and animal health. Ozone generators, which are portable or in-duct air cleaners that intentionally create ozone, can produce levels that are much higher than health-based standards. There are companies that try to sell the idea that breathing ozone is actually healthy, but there are 40 years of scientific studies that show even relatively low concentrations of ozone are harmful to biological tissue in plants and animals, including humans. It is well-documented that ozone can cause respiratory tract irritation and inflammation, serious breathing difficulty including asthma, permanent lung damage, and cardiovascular effects. The American Lung Association has concluded that breathing even low levels of ozone increases the risk of premature death.
 
There are industrial uses of ozone at high concentrations because it can kill biological pathogens and neutralize odors. Ozone used for these purposes is typically applied under controlled conditions to prevent human exposures. CARB strongly advises against the use of ozone generators at home because of the risk to you and your family's health from exposure to ozone.
 
In 2008, CARB enacted an air cleaner regulation to limit the ozone emissions from indoor air cleaning devices. The regulation requires all indoor air cleaners sold in California to be certified by CARB, including air cleaners sold online. Approved air cleaners are listed at California Certified Air Cleaning Devices, which is regularly updated. Approved air cleaners must also show a label on the packaging similar to the sample label shown below. Even though fully-integrated in-duct air cleaning devices are currently exempted from the regulation, some in-duct devices may create ozone at unhealthy levels. CARB is amending the air cleaner regulation to include in-duct devices in the future. For more information on the regulation, please read the Frequently Asked Questions.
 
In addition to CARB certification, there are other factors to consider in selecting a suitable air cleaner. It's important to choose an air cleaner with a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) that matches the size of the space you want to clean. So, check both the certified list and the information in the sections below to make the best choice for your needs.

Our most popular pressure pool cleaner, the Polaris Vac-Sweep 280 pressure-side pool cleaner works in all in-ground pools and requires a booster pump. It is powered by double jets, providing greater vacuum power and faster cleaning (3 hours or less). The Polaris 280 easily connects to a dedicated pressure line and sweeps, scrubs, and vacuums all surfaces of the pool. The pressure cleaner is equipped with a single chamber filter bag where it captures large debris such as leaves, acorns, pebbles, and other small to large debris. Its unique filter bag removes debris before it reaches your pump basket or filter, prolonging the life of your filtration system.
 
Verify that the wheel RPM's are in the correct range and adjust the thrust jet. If the cleaner isn't climbing well then ensure the thrust jet is in the 11 o'clock position. If it is going in circles then angle the thrust jet so it is pointing opposite of the way the cleaner is turning. For example, if the cleaner is turning right then point the thrust jet to the left.
 
Hold the back up valve out of the water and verify that it cycles on and off. A complete cycle takes about three minutes. If it stays on all the time or doesn't come on at all then replace the back up valve.
 
Verify the wheel RPM's are in range. If they are low or the wheels are not spinning then check the in-line filter for debris. If clear and the wheels still aren't spinning then check the water management system for clogs. If the RPM's are slightly below the prescribed range then remove the restrictor disc from the wall connector. If the wheels are moving too quickly then install the red restrictor disc.
 
Verify the wheel RPM's are in range. Ensure that the head float is not filled with water. Try running the cleaner without the bag and if it fixes the issue then clean the bag with soap and warm water. This will remove any biofilm/oils that may have accumulated in the
