I have a Windows Server 2012 R2 running SharePoint 2013 which I am trying to migrate from Hyper-V to KVM (qemu). I have converted the vhdx file to qcow2 format and copied it across to the KVM server (RHEL 7.3)

What's your tool for converting? MVMC? You can also try StarWind v2v converter: It was a big help at my time. And besides, it makes identical hard drive when converts from Hyper-v. Conversion itself is performing at the block level, so all the blocks should be copied unchanged.
 
Virtualization technology can improve the work efficiency of IT environment and more and more companies start to research multiple hypervisors to find the most proper virtualization solutions for different applications.
 
When a new hypervisor is selected as the alternative or complement to the existing hypervisor, it is necessary for IT administrators to learn VM migration procedures between different hypervisors because this is the fast way to make old applications work on the new hypervisor.
 
Virtual machine can work like the real machine but actually it exists as a folder on the host and this folder contains everything about the VM including configuration, applications, snapshots, and other data. When IT administrators move a VM from one hypervisor to another, the virtual disk is the most important thing. VMware will allow users to export full OVA template for data backup and later migration, you can also export OVA equivalent for Hyper-V VM.
 
Virtual disk is like the hard drive of physical machine. It is a file in the folder of VM and is saved in a different format in the different virtual environment. IT administrator often use virtual disk manager to manage virtual disk.

In Hyper-V environment, virtual disk is often saved as vhd or vhdx file. Vhd is the former format for Hyper-V virtual disk and vhds becomes its successor of it. Vhdx is has better performance than vhd. For example, the maximum capacity of vhd virtual disk is 2040GB but the maximum capacity of vhdx virtual disk is 64TB.
 
If you know the directory of Hyper-V VM folder, you can directly find and copy the vhdx virtual disk from the datastore. If you don't know the directory, you can still export the Hyper-V VM folder and then extract the vhdx virtual disk from it.
 
Both hypervisors have their advantages so you can add or change virtualization solution according to your needs. The next section will show you how to convert the virtual disk to move VM from Hyper-V to KVM.
 
Because different virtual environments require different virtual disk formats, you need to convert the virtual disk format before importing the virtual disk to new environment. For example, if you would like to convert Hyper-V virtual disk to KVM virtual disk, you need the V2V converter, qemu-img.

Different virtualization solutions have their advantages so you can select one or more of them to deploy virtual environment. Vhdx file and qcow2 file are the virtual disks of VMs in Hyper-V and KVM environment. To use vhdx virtual disk in KVM environment, you need to use qemu-img to convert vhdx to qcow2 before importing virtual disk.
 
At this point, we wanted to create a VM that we are going to use with the image we transferred. Here the key is to ensure that you make a VM that mirrors the Hyper-V VM in terms of CPU, RAM, network and disk options. Most modern OSes are supported via KVM so you should have little issue getting things to work, especially with Linux guests.
 
The command to convert our image and overwrite the empty qcow2 is very simple. We are going to use qemu-img convert, specify the output type and then the vhdx followed by the full path to the qcow2 image.
 
At this point, you should be able to boot the VM. There are still some tasks that will need to be completed. For example, updating network settings. Generally, this type of conversion will yield a different network interface so there are likely steps like setting that up in the guest OS that will need to happen. Platforms like Proxmox VE have built-in console viewer applications so we were able to do this post-transfer. Another option is to complete these steps before transferring/ converting the VM so that you can power-up and verify that the operation works.
 
Hi everyone, I am trying to migrate some VM from Hyper-V 2012 R2 to openstack. Most VM are gen2 and EFI enabled. Most of my VM are windows server 2012 R2.Below are the steps i followed for gen2: - Install VirtIO (all of them) drivers while VM is booted on the Hyper-V host- Converted the vhdx to qcow2 using cloudbase qemu-img- installed OVMF on compute nodes-Imported the qcow2 file into glance and set hwfirmwaretype=uefi- created instance from image FAILURE: windows not booting and getting message "your pc ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info and then we wil restart for you"
 
I managed to boot windows with the same image by setting "hwdiskbus=ide" however i can't attach any secondary volume to the instance since it will only attach as /dev/hda/ instead of "/dev/vdb" and windows guest cannot see it.
 
Hi Lucian, thank you for your answer. I ended up setting a KVM host outside of openstack and booted my converted VM as IDE. Once the VM is booted i added a second disk as virtio disk this time, which triggered Windows to somehow "correctly" instal the viostor and vioscsi drivers knowing that i have already installed these drivers using pnputil while the VM was on hyper-v..I then shutdown the VM changed the bootable disk to VirtIO and rebooted, and windows guest booted normaly, which allowed me to move it to Openstack. It is a bit longer process but i can move forward. I hope this will help anyone in the future.
 
Virtio drivers can even be installed offline using dism.exe. We have some scripts that prepare Windows images which may serve as an example: -openstack-imaging-tools/blob/master/Examples/create-windows-cloud-image.ps1
 
Anyway, the fact that the instance boots when using IDE makes me think there's something wrong with the virtio drivers. Double check that those are properly installed (especially viostor/vioscsi). If so, you can try a different version.
 
This document is for platform administrators and application owners that runvirtual machines (VMs) in VM Runtime on GDC. This document shows youhow to manually convert an existing virtual disk image to theqcow2 format so that you can create and run VMs in VM Runtime on GDC usingthat source image. You then learn how to create a VM directly from thisconverted virtual disk image.
 
VM Runtime on GDC automatically converts an existing disk image tothe qcow2 format during deployment if needed. However, if you want to createmultiple VMs from a non-qcow2 virtual disk image, VM Runtime on GDCmust convert the image every time. This process to convert the image to theqcow2 format increases the amount of time it takes to create and start the VM.To reduce the time it takes to create each VM, convert the virtual disk image tothe qcow2 format first, as shown in this document.
 
In this document, you use theQEMU disk image utility to convert existing virtual disk images to the qcow2 format. The qemu-imgtool can convert virtual disk images from multiple formats, such as vmdk orvhdx, to the qcow2 format for use with VM Runtime on GDC.
 
If you want to see your converted virtual disk image in action, create a VM anduse the local qcow2-formatted image created in the previous section. Forproduction use, you should upload your converted virtual disk image to a centralrepository and thencreate a VM boot disk from HTTP source orfrom Cloud Storage using a Secret.

I need to convert a vmdk to vhdx to be used with Hyper-V. I converted the file using this:
qemu-img.exe -p -f vmdk -O vhdx -o subformat=dynamic C:\Hyper-V\Imports\VMWare\FreeRadiusAAMES\FreeRadiusAAMES.vmdk C:\Hyper-V\VHDs\FreeRadius.vhdx
 
Failed to Power on with Error 'The requested operation could not be completed due to a virtual disk system limitation. Virtual hard disk files must be uncompressed and unencrypted and must not be sparse.
 
**NOTE** Although the final image will be around the same size as the actual amount of data on the server, the Proxmox VE server should have enough free space to fit the total physical disk of the server unless you plan to shrink the windows disks. once migrated to Proxmox VE.
 
**NOTE:** Depending on your hardware, you may need to boot the .vmdk file using VMware Workstation or Player before moving the file to the Proxmox VE server. This allows windows to install additional drivers for the disk controller. If promoted to convert the disk to Workstation 9.x compatibility, say Yes. You won't know if you need this step until starting the Windows VM in the final step. If you get a blue screen during boot, you should try this step.
 
Once the VMware converter has completed, disable all of the networks adapters on the physical server and shut down. Disabling the network adapters will avoid potential IP conflicts if you will start the physical server back into Windows after you have your new virtual server running.
