Thanks for reaching out. How are you saving the images? Would you mind sharing the workflow? Are you trying to do it the same way as shown in the article above? We're here to help, just need some info. Thanks.
 
Did you ever get it working? Now mine won't save with a watermark on the app. I have looked at settings and all. I'm an iPhone user and this just started happening. I would really hate to end my subscription because it's a total inconvenience.
 
With the rise of digital photography, more and more of us are sharing our images on the internet. This is a great way to get advice, improve your technique, and meet likeminded people, but it does have a downside - copyright theft.
 
It's becoming increasingly important to protect your images and prevent (or at least dissuade) unscrupulous people from using them without your permission. Adding a watermark to your photos is the ideal way to do this.
 
Applying a watermark in Photoshop is quick and easy. You can add a simple text watermark or one based around a logo or image; I'll describe each in turn. For this tutorial I'll be using the following image - feel free to download it and follow along.

With the new layer selected, choose the Text tool. Click anywhere on the image and type your copyright notice. Don't worry about the font, size, position, or colour for now; we'll change all of these in a minute.
 
If you'd like to add any special characters (such as the copyright symbol), you can insert these using the Windows Character Map (Start > Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Character Map) or Mac OS X's Character Pallette (Edit > Special Characters). As a shortcut, the copyright symbol () can be inserted in Windows by holding Alt and typing "0169" on the numeric keypad, and in Mac OS X by pressing Option+G.
 
Select the Text tool and highlight your copyright notice. Use the toolbar to change the font face and colour to suit your personal tastes. You can also play around with the font size, although we'll be resizing the watermark in the next step anyway.
 
Next you need to choose where your watermark is going to go. I like to put mine on an area of roughly even colour where it isn't obscuring the main subject of the shot, usually near a corner. You might like to make yours more prominent, so do whatever you prefer.
 
If you want to resize or rotate your watermark, use the Free Transform tool (Ctrl+T in Windows, Cmd+T on Mac). When resizing, remember to hold down Shift to constrain the text's proportions and stop it getting stretched out of shape.
 
The watermark is ok as it stands, but it's not particularly subtle and really draws the eye. This can be quickly corrected by adjusting the layer's opacity - somewhere between 30% and 50% tends to work well.
 
You might want to jazz the text up a bit by adding some effects to it. The Bevel and Emboss effect can look good and is useful for separating the watermark from the background on some images. Don't go overboard though - a simple watermark is easier to read and less distracting.
 
If you're a professional photographer, blogger, or enthusiast with your own logo, you can use that as your watermark rather than plain text. It's a little bit more involved but can be really effective. For this example I'm going to watermark the same image with the Photography Mad logo:
 
In order for your logo to make an effective watermark, you first need to remove all colour from it. This means opening the original file and converting all elements to black, white, or a shade of gray, like so:
 
Select the logo's layer and change the blending mode to "Darken". This will make the white background disappear, leaving only the black and grey areas. As before, change the layer's opacity to make the watermark semi-transparent.
 
I think this watermark would look better in white than black, and this is easy to do. First, add an "Invert" adjustment layer (Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Invert). In the Layers panel, position the Invert layer directly above the logo layer. Highlight it, then hold Alt/Option and click on the line between the two layers. This will link the two, ensuring that only the logo is inverted rather than the entire image. Finally, select the logo layer and change its blend mode to "Lighten". You should now be left with a light logo, as below.
 
You can also apply this technique to colour logos, although these can clash with the photo's colours and be difficult to read. I'd recommend sticking to a simple black and white logo wherever possible.
 
If you want to take things a step further, you can even create a Photoshop action which applies the watermark to an image. This will allow you to add it with a single click, or even run a batch process on several images to add it to all of them.
 
As I've hopefully demonstrated, it's easy to create an effective watermark that doesn't detract from your photo. A watermark won't necessarily stop people using your images, but it will reduce the chances of it happening, and at least you'll get some credit for your work when it does.
 
With social media and online content being such widely used outlets for photographers to showcase their images, it is more important than ever to protect them the best you can to prevent them from being claimed by other photographers.
 
Making sure you are working on the new layer, select the text tool. Now click anywhere on the image to begin adding the text. Choose the font, text size, and color you desire, and then type the text you want to use.
 
Start by opening your actions panel. Next, click on the "Create New Action" button at the bottom of the Actions Panel. This button looks like a square with a corner folded up. When you click this, a new dialog box will open, asking you to name your action, so go ahead and do that. Then press the "Record" button.
 
Now all the steps you take in Photoshop will be recorded. Just follow the steps we described above to add your watermark. When you are finished adding the watermark to your image, press the "Stop" button to tell Photoshop to stop recording what you are doing.
 
Now, the process of adding a watermark to your image has been turned into an Action. To run the action you just created, highlight the action and press "Play." Once the action runs and adds your text, you can go into the layers panel to select the text and make any necessary changes, including changing the text location or the color.
 
Another way to watermark your images is to add a logo or design. In most cases, this would be one you have already created (or had made for you) to use for your advertisement purposes, such as your website, business cards, flyers, etc.
 
Once again, be mindful of the logo design you are using. The logo on your website or business cards may NOT be the best one to use for watermarking purposes. You may need to change the color to something more simple and less distracting, like black or white.
 
**Adding a watermark using a custom Photoshop brush is probably the FASTEST and EASIEST way to add watermarks to your photos quickly. You can set this up with both a text or logo design.**
 
You will also need to make sure that your logo is on a white background before creating a brush with it. So make any adjustments you need to (as far as resolution and grayscale) before converting it to a brush.
 
If you plan on creating more than one watermark brush (maybe one for a logo/design and a separate one for basic text), make sure to name them accordingly. After naming your brush, press OK to save it. **You now have a custom watermark brush ready to use at any time!**
 
From now on, it won't be necessary to repeat these steps each time you want to use your watermark brush. It will automatically be saved in Photoshop once you complete the steps to name and define it. Then, adding a watermark to your image will be as easy as selecting your brush and placing it wherever you like!
 
**Watermarking images is an important part of photography. If you follow these steps, adding watermarks to your photos can become a very quick and easy process, ESPECIALLY if you turn your watermark into a Photoshop Action or Brush to save even MORE time!**

Another thing to remember is that resizing your logo can be tricky. **If your logo is initially big-sized, then you will be able to scale it down without losing its quality**. However, if you import a small-sized watermark and try to make it bigger, then it will look blurry, pixelated and overall, not very appealing or professional. Therefore, you need to make sure that your watermark is of a big enough size.
 
Once you decide on your logo, but before you import it into Photoshop, **you will need to start recording a new action**. This will make it easier for you to add your logo to other images with just a couple of clicks!
 
If you feel like your watermark is too close to the edges of your frame, select only the logo layer, then hold Shift and press the arrow keys on your keyboard. For instance, you can hit two times on the right and two times on the up.
 
There are no alignment buttons in Visual Watermark, but you can **position your watermark anywhere within the frame**. Just click on it to select, then drag it with your cursor. There are purple guiding lines that will help you align your watermark properly. For instance, they will show you when yo
