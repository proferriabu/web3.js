We play several instruments during the 45 minute class, and rhythm sticks are one of them. But nothing in my song collection was jumping out at me, so I decided to write a new one. That particular day it had been storming on and off all morning, which inspired **Thunder & Raindrops**.

When I introduced this song at Church Mice for the first time yesterday, I had the children practice making both thunder and raindrop sounds by playing their sticks on the floor. Thunder was loud, slow and steady, while raindrops were quick and a little softer (or as soft as three-year-olds will play).
 
His partnership with Walter Becker in the peerless Steely Dan had illuminated the 1970s music scene with astonishing lightning bolts of twisted, subversive, hyper intelligence, lyrical misdirection, mystery and musical sophistication.

He was then in his early 30s and aware that the tides of time were inescapably moving him into a new phase of life. Of course, like the tides there were powerful attractions both to the push towards the future and the alluring pull of the past.
 
And, the diligent listener to The Nightfly will find themselves glancingly educated (which is often the very best way to be educated) about the moral, social, commercial, political and cultural history of the United States at the hinge of the 1950s and 1960s.
 
Yet, you can be sure a whip smart, newspaper reading, TV watching, cinema going, obsessive radio listener like young Donald would have, by a process of osmosis, been saturated in the optimism of the age.
 
The future sure looks bright but maybe there are storms brewing which will sweep in from near and far to upset this vision. Looking back it is possible to celebrate what was a glorious time and still shiver as you contemplate terrible events just around the bend.
 
The title track is just wonderful. Like so many us marooned in the stifling suburbs Donald escaped (at least in his imagination) with the aid of late night DJs heard on a much treasured bedroom transistor radio.
 
Surely a graveyard shift program, on an independent station, where deep into the night you could spin the music of your jazz idols and converse with like minded souls until the sun came through the skylight.
 
This is a man who affirms that the music of Ray Charles rescued a generation by liberating them from emotional suppression which was the fallout from World War 2. You can feel that conviction in the music of The Nightfly even at its most wearied low point.
 
**The Raindrops** were an American pop group from New York, United States, associated with the Brill Building style of 1960s pop. The group existed from 1963 to 1965 and consisted of Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry, both of whom worked as writer/producers for numerous other acts before, during and after their tenure as The Raindrops.
 
The group was formed around the nucleus of childhood friends Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich.[1] Greenwich had recorded a single in 1958 ("Cha-Cha Charming", as Ellie Gaye) while a college student, and Barry began working for a Brill Building music publisher in 1959, penning the hit "Tell Laura I Love Her" amongst others.[1] The two met again that year and began dating; simultaneously, they began writing songs together, mainly for other artists. However, a couple of Greenwich-led discs were issued in the early 1960s under pseudonyms, one credited to Ellie Gee and The Jets, another to Kelli Douglas.
 
In early 1963, Greenwich and Barry recorded a demo of their composition "What a Guy",[1] a tune Barry had written for The Sensations. However, the group's label, Jubilee Records, chose to release Barry and Greenwich's demo as the single under the name 'The Raindrops'[1] (the group name was reportedly inspired by "Raindrops," a 1961 hit song by Dee Clark).
 
The single hit number 41 on the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100, and the follow-up, "The Kind of Boy You Can't Forget", peaked at number 17.[1] The Raindrops sound was "girl-group" in style, with Greenwich singing lead vocal and double-tracked harmony parts, and Barry providing nonsense-syllable bass vocals.
 
At this point, the group began to attract attention. Media stills of the group often depicted the group as a trio, featuring Greenwich and Barry as well as Greenwich's younger sister Laura, who did not sing on the records.[1] The Raindrops made occasional live appearances, but rarely with the same personnel as on record; Ellie Greenwich sometimes had Beverly Warren sing live for her, and Bobby Bosco filled in at times for Barry.[1] To preserve the illusion that the group was a trio, Laura Greenwich also occasionally appeared in live performances with the group, singing into a dead microphone.
 
The Raindrops released an album on Jubilee towards the end of 1963; a third single, "That Boy John", was a minor hit,[1] but sank at radio after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. After a few further minor hits, Barry and Greenwich stopped releasing material as The Raindrops in early 1965, around the same time they became involved with Red Bird Records.[1]
 
Both Greenwich and Barry enjoyed successful careers as songwriters after the demise of The Raindrops, and Greenwich went on to a modest solo career as a singer as well. They divorced late in 1965, although they continued to write songs together for a time. They reunited on record for a 1967 single credited to The Meantime, which failed to chart. This was their last professional project as a duo.

There's also some accordion, ukulele, viola, and delicately plucked (and rather toy-sounding) acoustic guitar. Virtually all of these instruments seem to personify the titular raindrops, which these songs are not so much "about" as wholly comprised of, figuratively speaking -- and so, come to think of it, do Yoshimi Tomida's vocals, at least on the onomatopoeic "Pitter Patter Interlude." Needless to say, there's a considerable amount of cuteness and whimsy on display here -- but that's not to suggest that this music is simplistic or overly precious. Apart from that admittedly cutesy interlude, the album is largely instrumental (Tomida's vocals appear on three other tracks, but they're either considerably muffled or substantially processed and manipulated), and largely concerned with gently building up layers of sound to create lush and lazy soundscapes that are wistful and winsome but still majestic in their quiet way. If the song titles and instrumentation make the childlike qualities of Lullatone's music inescapable, and perhaps suggest a whiff of gimmicky novelty, the music itself reveals that essence to be much more fundamental -- even performed entirely on "adult" synthesizers and classical instruments and given banal, non-descriptive titles (which these pieces are both abstract and accomplished enough to accommodate), the music's simple beauty and sense of wonder would remain undeniable." allmusic.com $(".tralbum-about").last().bcTruncate(TruncateProfile.get("tralbum\_about"), "more", "less")
