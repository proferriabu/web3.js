We want to ensure racers and enthusiasts are able to maximise the use of their road and race cars over the winter months by supplying ready-to-race simulators for your home. Our simulator packages take all the hard work out of owning and building a simulator thanks to our complete tailored packed which are simply plug and play with ongoing support from our team of experts. You just get in and drive.
 
Using a perfect fusion of custom component and professional grade hardware we can accurately replicate the sensations experienced and techniques required when driving real cars at their limits. Our simulators have been designed and developed by racing drivers to ensure realism and that the data and feelings are transferrable to the real world.
 
With a number of clients already racing in the caterhamracer.com eSeries, we are excited to continue to support them, bring new drivers to the series and help take existing members to the next level with their simulators!
 
With this new profiles this does no longer happen. To achieve this I now use the in game Wheel Damper setting with a value of 2 (previously 0), combined with a lower NDP compared to before to accomodate the damping from the games Wheel Damper.

Together with this change I also changed the in game FFB strength setting from 50 to 60 and decreased the Tuning Menu FFB from 75 to 45 which results in less peaks which were quite heavy to fight against.
 
Question: I noticed talk about substantial rewrite of the code for driver 442/443. For longtime fanatec users, what should be our expectations regarding a change in the FFB experience with this new generation of driver/firmware (generally and for certain games like F1, ACC, and DR2)?
 
Thanks a lot for these profiles. I tried the F3 and it immediately improved my lap time. As a personal preference, I would like the FFB to be a bit strong ger. Should I increase the max force in iracing or in fanalab? is there a risk of losing any details?
 
Just curious, I notice all of your ACC profiles have FEI still set at 80 even with the new firmware/drivers. Is this still your personal preference to counter vibrations? It seems Marcel is currently recommending FEI at 100 and tinkering with INT instead.
 
"FEI is suggested at 100 because it's the most responsive setting, following the intended FFB signal most precisely. FEI 90 or 80 can be used for personal preference to counter unwanted vibration effects but I personally would not suggest to go lower as it can create input lag and cause oscillation. A setting which works better to solve unwanted noise and vibration is the interpolation setting (INT). It's a less harsh filter which doesn't introduce as much downsides as FEI."
 
I am mainly playing F1 games 2021 and now 22, and some ACC, and have always used fanatec recommended settings. I am not so "skilled", playing not at a high level, I am just trying to better feel the car through the wheel, especially grip limits, and though that maybe fanalb could help me go one step further in term of feeling.
 
However, I have a lot of difficulties to find ressources on how to correctly setup fanalb with those games : I saw @Maurice Bschen profiles, but they seemed to be made for DD2/DD1 base. Is it possible to give some clue to adapt them to CSL DD, or do I have to go through a long process of trials and errors from "start" .
 
I have used your profiles for ACC Maurice and I love them. I am having an issue with the profiles for iRacing. I keep having an extreme oscillation issue. Doesn't matter which profile I use. I am on Driver 439. I am using your profiles for Fanalab 1.64.5. Do I need to update my DD1 drivers to 442? 

 
What i dont understand is the dirt road profiles dont feel great, even the standard one, and i have been doing some research and tried tweaking but cant get any better. iRacing road tracks is amazing, never tried dirt oval. But Dirt road is awful. Is is just I need to tune my wheel settings for dirt road or is it just poor quality game for road and I am wasting my time. ie stick to Road on iracing and try a different game for rallycross type of game. Thoughts people?
 
any chance you can lend a little if your magic to creating a few profiles for Dirt Rally2? Perhaps a classic car profile (older cars/rear-wheel-drive/no power-steering/etc.), and then one for newer cars?

I'm planning to buy the rFactor game, but most of the people in the LFS forums say it's incredibly unrealistic sim, however some other people say you just have to install the best mods. So i'm going to play the 60min trial, but before playing install some new cars to it, maybe new track also. So my question is, wich is the MOST realistic car mod for rFactor? It also should be very fun to drive.
 
And try the first (PCC2007) and, if you're up for it, the next two or three. Or you can go through the episodes and check the physics, FFB etc scores for each of the cars in the list (it'll take some time though).
 
Well, i tested the Caterham mod, Because i'm a fan of caterhams and I have to say it wasn't kinda what i expected, i have some time of the trial still left so i might test the PCC2007 mod or whatever it was today if got some time
 
If you want more time with rFactor, just re-download/re-install it. will buy you an extra 60mins or whatever. I got my copy for 2 so I cant knock it. one thing i will say about the Caterham mod is it was a little disappointed till I figured out you have to unlock the faster versions (caterbusa= 1insane beast). struggling to keep the wheels in-line ever since I'll second the fact you really should try the PCC 2007. truly a work of art.
 
IMO Rfactor is quite complex to setup properly, is it possible that you have set something incorrectly in real feel or the control's setting?. I dunno, i found the caterham's drove very nicely and the FFb was nice.
 
I'm having a huge issue with it though, I'm getting really bad stutters. The FPS is very high but still getting a lot of stutters, doesn't matter if I'm in the cockpit or a different camera or even replays it stutters really bad. I switched over the HistorX and then V8 Unleashed and it ran butter smooth so it's just this mod. Any ideas what might be going on?
 
Uke,one thing I would recommend if you are new to sim racing is start out in the slower cars such as the Caterham (an excellent mod)and learn how to drive properly.It may appear slow and boring at first until you get on the track with real drivers in an online session and you are 3-10 seconds(depending on the car) off the pace and not able to keep it on the track when you push hard.When you decide what sim you will race(there are others out there,look for simbin also) I would also suggest joining a league and getting involved with the community.There is no shortage of people in any sim ready to help out.
 
You should try the iracing 3 month deal sometime just to have a look but beware iRacing is heavily addicting and as previously mentioned expensive.There is a lot to choose from these days and they all supply a good product each with their own ardent supporters.I pretty well have them all collected from over the years.
 
Some tracks are harder on FPS than others.Stuttering is usually a result of low FPS.I would get that with certain F1 mods.Is the stuttering constant or is it worse on certain corners with perhaps tires making noise?Does it stutter when you're alone on the track or only around other cars.The start is often the worse time for stuttering with all the cars,pits and grandstands in view.
 
Since 2007, Inside Sim Racing has been the number one show dedicated to the world of simulated motorsports. Every episode, we will bring you stories from a variety of genres in the world of Simulated Racing.
