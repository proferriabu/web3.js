Suggestions?

Not sure if I understand correctly but you can set any field value you want to see to be displayed on your watch. You would have to change the data fields in layouts of the respective activity. For pace you have pace, average pace, lap pace, and last lap pace as choices. When you manually press lap button it shows you the summary of the last lap, meaning the precise pace you ran the last lap. Does that help?
 
Thanks spike, I cannot choose Average Pace, that's not an option, only Pace, which unfortunately is Current Pace. When I use manual laps, pressing the manual lap button is what gives me the new lap, right? And it shows lap number and duration on lap... 


 
With the lap button it shows you the summary of the lap you just did for a few seconds. Normally it displays number of the lap done, required time needed and pace of the lap done. After a few seconds the summary disappears automatically and the watch displays the standard running data screen (current lap), which can be customised in settings.

Objectives:  Present analysis of the federal and state regulations that guide The Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) operations and core clinical features for direction on behavioral health (BH).
 
Design:  Review and synthesize the federal (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS]) and all publicly available state manuals according to the BH-Serious Illness Care (SIC) model domains.
 
Methods:  A multipronged search was conducted to identify official state and federal manuals guiding the implementation and functions of PACE organizations. The CMS PACE website was used to identify the federal PACE manual. State-level manuals for 32 states with PACE programs were identified through several sources, including official PACE websites, contacts through official websites, the National PACE Association (NPA), and public and academic search engines. The manuals were searched according to the BH-SIC model domains that pertain to integrating BH care with complex care individuals.
 
Results:  According to the CMS Manual, the interdisciplinary team is responsible for holistic care of PACE enrollees, but a BH specialist is not a required member. The CMS Manual includes information on BH clinical functions, BH workforce, and structures for outcome measurement, quality, and accountability. Eight of 32 PACE-participating states offer publicly available state PACE manuals; of which 3 offer information on BH clinical functions.
 
Conclusions and implications:  Regarding BH, federal and state manual regulations establish limited guidance for comprehensive care service delivery at PACE organizations. The absence of clear directives weakens BH care delivery due to a limiting the ability to develop quality measures and accountability structures. This hinders incentivization and accountability to truly all-inclusive care. Clearer guidelines and regulatory parameters regarding BH care at federal and state levels may e
