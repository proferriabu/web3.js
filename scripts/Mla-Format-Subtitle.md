A subtitle or closed caption file contains the text of what is said in the video. It also contains time codes for when each line of text should be displayed. Some files also include position and style info, which is especially useful for deaf or hard of hearing viewers. See what file formats YouTube supports below.
 
VTT? SRT? TTML? ABCDEFG? Subtitle file formats can seem pretty complicated. There are a lot of variations out there because of the many different options we have to view video, like television or YouTube. It may be tempting to choose a subtitle file type at the top of a dropdown list or something that is familiar (i.e., TXT), but it will save you time in the long run to understand which file format is just right for you, based on what you plan to do with the subtitles.

1. **Using other subtitling editing tools might erase some of the work you did on Amara.**For example, editing subtitles in the YouTube editor gets rid of any top-positioning you might have done to subtitles made on Amara.
 
2. **Always use a programming text editor like Notepad++, TextEdit (MacOS) or gedit (Linux) to open subtitle files.**Using a standard text editor like Windows Notepad or a word processor with autocorrections (like Office Word) can alter formatting and render the file unusable.
 
4. **Save time by s** **etting up automatic subtitle export from Amara to the video platform of your choice.** The Amara knowledge base has instructions for some of the most popular video sites around, including YouTube, Vimeo, and Kaltura. Check out the links below:

We have subtitling solutions that can help individuals and organizations of any size, including creating captions and subtitles for you.
 
Usually, a timing issue like what you describe can be resolved using the Clear Timings feature in the Editor (click on the Clock icon, then Clear timing). However, it is important to note that the will clear ALL the timing in the subtitles. Clear timing is a great tool to use when not a lot of syncing has already been done on the subtitles, and it may not be a suitable solution for all timing issues.
 
Good question! It depends on where your subtitles will be shown. Broadcast television in North America usually uses SCC (Scenarist Closed Caption) files. But if you are creating subtitles for online streaming television, the most simplest option would probably be SRT subtitles. I hope this helps! Happy subtitling!
 
Note that the accepted answer suggests an older version of the SSA format, using \aX instead of \anX. The numbers used in the older format are also different, and that format is considered deprecated. The newer format uses the numpad layout for the numbers. While SMplayer correctly displays both formats, VLC only accepts the current \anX format.

As far as I know there is no such setting in the .srt format (this is confirmed by this page), that will depend on the program you use to view your videos. For example, in the settings of vlc you have "Force subtitle position":
 
There is an extended SRT format specification. The link to visualsubsync merely confirms that this very program only supports the standard spec. It also implies that there indeed is support for coordinations and there is:
 
You can add captions to figures, equations, or other objects. A caption is a numbered label, such as "Figure 1", that you can add to a figure, a table, an equation, or another object. It's comprised of customizable text ("Figure", "Table", "Equation" or something else that you type) followed by an ordered number or letter ("1, 2, 3..." or "a, b, c..." typically) which can be optionally followed by some additional, descriptive, text if you like.
 
In the Label list, select the label that best describes the object, such as a figure or equation. If the list doesn't provide the label you want, click New Label, type the new label in the Label box, and then click OK.
 
On the Captions dialog box, click AutoCaption, and then select the check boxes for the items that you want Word to automatically add captions to. You can also choose which position to add captions to in the Position drop-down list.
 
If you want to be able to wrap text around the object and its caption, or you want to be able to move the object and the caption as one unit, you must first group the object and the caption together.
 
Once you've added at least one caption to your document you should see a new style displayed on the style gallery called "Caption". To change the formatting of your captions throughout your document simply right-click that style on the gallery and choose Modify. You can set font size, color, type and other options that will apply to your captions.
 
To delete a caption select it and press Delete. When you're finished deleting captions, you should update the remaining set of captions in your document. Press CTRL+A to select all of the text in your document and then press F9 to update all. This will ensure that your caption numbers are correct after any caption removal.

The second widely used format is MicroDVD. Unlike SRT, in this format, the binding is carried out not by time but by frame number. In general, this is not so reliable. If the frame rate of your copy of the movie and the one for which the subtitles were made do not match, the synchronization will be lost. The file structure looks like that:
 
It is an advanced subtitle format that allows you to control many text parameters: font format, color, height, transparency, text location on frames. This format is quite popular and is widely supported by players along with SRT, though its syntax is not as simple:
 
Next is a Microsoft official format SAMI (Synchronised Accessible Media Interchange). It is relatively flexible and well-documented, however, it is very difficult to find a good converter for it. In its structure, it is very reminiscent of an HTML document, because the format was developed on its basis:
 
If you wonder if there is a universal subtitle format that would work in most video players, the simplest and most common ones are SRT and VTT. They also work on most popular video platforms and social media pages.
 
The tool allows you to easily move the position of subtitles and change their duration. Plus, you can stylize their color, font, size and see it on the video right away. After you finish editing the text, you can get the caption file separately or simply download the video with subtitles already embedded.
 
Because Matroska is a general container format, we try to avoid specifying the formatsto store in it. This type of work is really outside of the scope of a container-only format.However, because the use of subtitles in A/V containers has been so limited (with the exception of DVD)we are taking the time to specify how to store some of the more common subtitle formats in Matroska.This is being done to help facilitate their growth. Otherwise, incompatibilities could preventthe standardization and use of subtitle storage.
 
This page is not meant to be a complete listing of all subtitle formats that will be used in Matroska,it is only meant to be a guide for the more common, current formats. It is possible thatwe will add future formats to this page as they are created, but it is not likely as anyother new subtitle format designer would likely have their own specifications.Any specification listed here **SHOULD** be strictly adhered to or it **SHOULD NOT**use the corresponding Codec ID.
 
The requirement for muxing VobSub into Matroska is v7 subtitles (see first line of the .IDX file).If the version is smaller, you must remux them using the SubResync utility fromVobSub 2.23 (or MPC) into v7 format. Generally any newly created subs will be in v7 format.
 
1. A number indicating which subtitle it is in the sequence.2. The time that the subtitle appears on the screen, and then disappears.3. The subtitle itself.4. A blank line indicating the start of a new subtitle.
 
When placing SRT in Matroska, part 3 is converted to UTF-8 (S\_TEXT/UTF8) and placedin the data portion of the Block. Part 2 is used to set the timestamp of the Block,and BlockDuration element. Nothing else is used.
 
For detailed information on SSA/ASS, see the SSA specs.It includes an SSA specs description and the advanced features added by ASS format (standing for Advanced SSA).Because SSA and ASS are so similar, they are treated the same here.
 
If there is no Matroska BlockAddition element stored together with the Matroska Block,then all three components (Cue Settings List, Cue Identifier, Cue Comments) **MUST** be assumed to be absent.
 
A Segment is normally shown until a subsequent Segment is encountered. Therefore the Matroska Block**MAY** have no Duration. In that case, a player **MUST** display a Segment within a Matroska Blockuntil the next Segment is encountered.
 
Each Segment contains a start and an end presentation timestamp (short: start PTS & end PTS).The start PTS will be used as the timestamp for the Matroska Block. The Matroska Block **MUST**have a Duration, and that Duration is the difference between the end PTS and the start PTS.
 
Each HDMV text subtitle stream in a Blu-ray can use one of a handful of character sets.This information is not stored in the MPEG2 Transport Stream itself but in the accompanying Clip Information file.
 
Therefore a muxer **MUST** parse the accompanying Clip Information file. If the info
