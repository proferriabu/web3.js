Whether you're an experienced arranger or casual producer, Vintage Strings was designed to make it quick and easy for you to create great sounding string tracks for your productions. Like its sister product, Vintage Horns, Vintage Strings was not designed to be a shiny, perfect sounding virtual instrument. Instead, Big Fish Audio tried to capture the way string sections sounded back in the '60s and '70s; including the decidedly not classical playing style and minor imperfections that added character to those sections and made them sound so good.

For Vintage Strings, Big Fish Audio recorded a 6 piece violin section using vintage Neuman U-87 mics and Royer ribbon mics run through a great sounding SSL board. To capture a true vintage string sound, Big Fish Audio used close mics, room mics, and string section positioning based on actual session notes from old Motown and Philly Soul recording sessions. Rather than record the violins in a magnificent concert hall or some other large and resonant recording space, Big Fish Audio recorded their players in a funky old studio with a smaller, less-reverberant room that had characteristics similar to the rooms used to record classic Soul and R&B records. Using the tracks Big Fish Audio recorded in this space, tey then created three types of sections:
 
The 2VLN patches are very useful for creating the sound of smaller string sections. Even if played in 3-part harmony, these patches sound like a 6 piece section, rather than a full orchestral string section. The 2VLN patches take up a lot less sonic space in the mix and also have the advantage of sounding like the smaller types of string sections used on a lot of old Soul and R&B records, which didn't have the time or budget to record a larger section.

The 6VLN patches are great for recording unison (1 part) lines that emulate the sound of a true 6 violin section, which was very commonly used in many old Soul recordings. When used for 2-part harmonies or octaves these patches can be used to replicate the sound of an overdubbed 6 violin section (i.e., a faux 12 violin section), which was a very common recording technique used on many Motown recording sessions.
 
The 12VLN patches are very useful for creating unison (1 part) string lines that sound like an overdubbed 6 violin section. If you want to get a bigger sound with the size of a larger orchestral string section, without the color and character present in a large recording hall or symphonic space, use the patches for string parts in 2 or 3 part harmonies.
 
The result is a virtual instrument that has a sound and character that is distinctly different from orchestral based sampled string libraries. The sound of Vintage Strings is intentionally not big, rich, and glossy. It's a smaller, more intimate, and more "human" sound, which more accurately emulates the string sound on those classic old records.
 
If you don't have a lot of experience writing for strings, or even if you're an experienced string-arranger on a tight deadline, Vintage Strings also offers a number of pre-programmed instrument patches that can help you quickly create great sounding string parts. These include the Tonal Harmonization Patches, which contain 2 part, 3 part, and 4 part patches for 2, 6, and 12 violins. Playing with just one finger on your keyboard you can easily write string lines in 2 parts (intervals), 3 parts (triads), or 4 parts (seventh chords). Secondly, the Tonal Harmonization patches include Fixed Chord & Interval Patches containing 2 part, 3 part, and 4 part Chord Patches, for 2, 6, and 12 violins. These patches are programmed to play a specific interval or chord according to the type of patch in 12 different keys.
 
The Vintage Strings graphical user interface (GUI) is very simple and easy to use. The main page of the interface includes control over tape saturation, high EQ, and reverb with 15 custom selected convolution reverbs.
 
The Foundry is a third-party library, based in Native Instruments' Kontakt Engine. In general, whatever is listed on NI's Kontakt website for the current version will be the machine requirements for The Foundry. Big Fish Audio highly recommend running The Foundry on a computer with SSD drives for optimal performance.
 
These days composers and music producers have no shortage of choices when it comes to getting high quality string libraries. Each month a new library comes out with a specific new legato or sampled in a world famous hall. So how is a developer to stand out? Instead of trying to compete with the traditional string libraries all pretty much trying to fill the film music niche, Funk Soul Productions and Big Fish Audio have instead focused on a specific sound of strings: Vintage.
 
Overall the sound and extended articulations of this library is the big selling point. The playback produces a silky smooth vintage vibe. Each of the Kontakt instruments come with a HIGH EQ and TAPE SATURATION knob that let you to dial in even more of that vintage tone.
 
The included articulations for are Sustain + Staccato, Swells, Major Runs Up, Major Runs Down, Minor Runs Up, Minor Runs Down, Fall-Offs, Tremolo, Harmonics & Pizzicato. I found the keyswitch instruments to be very easy to play and the vintage plate effect included to be spot on for the desired sound.
 
Playing chords with the 2 Violin patches is surprisingly full, yet intimate and gives a natural, unscripted divisi which works really well for the sustains, trems and chordal playing of the short notes.
 
Overall for a specialty string libraries the price point seems about right. But, as I mentioned in the video, the Vintage Collection, a bundle with the Vintage Strings, Vintage Horns and Vintage Rhythm Section is where this set of instruments becomes a really great deal.
 
Vintage Strings 2 from Funk/Soul Productions and Big Fish Audio is a sequel to the best-selling library Vintage Strings. The original library was designed to emulate the smaller, violin-based string sections used in many 1960s-70s vintage R&B and Soul productions. Now, Vintage Strings 2 expands on this concept with completely new samples of the larger string sections of that same era, including violas and cellos in addition to violins. These strings, found in vintage R&B, Soul, Jazz, and Pop productions, have a more intimate sound than typical orchestral string sections. Vintage Strings 2 brings the authentically lush string sounds of the golden era of popular music to hobbyists and professionals alike.
 
As with all of the instruments in the Vintage VI series, the goal for Vintage Strings 2 was not to create a shiny, perfect-sounding virtual instrument. Instead, we tried to capture the way larger string sections sounded back in the 60s and 70s, including the minor imperfections that added character to those sections and made them sound so good.
 
To this end, Big Fish Audio and Funk Soul Productions recorded VS2 with vintage Neuman U-87 mics and Royer ribbon mics. Rather than record the strings in a concert hall or some other large and resonant recording space, they recorded them in an old studio with a smaller, less-reverberant room.
 
The result is a virtual instrument that has a sound and character that is distinctly different from orchestral-based sampled strings libraries. The sound of Vintage Strings 2 is rich but not overly "sweet" or glossy. It's a more intimate and more "human" sound, which we feel more accurately emulates the larger string section sounds from the classic records of the 1960s and 70s
 
For VS2, Big Fish Audio and Funk Soul Productions recorded several different string sections in isolation, organized into different configurations in order to provide maximum flexibility. These include:
 
The most powerful feature of Vintage Strings 2 is the Harmonize function. You can create custom chord intervals for your sections. For example, change the root note to a 5th an octave up with twist of a knob. This allows you to easily write inspiring section parts, even with limited musical knowledge. With Vintage Strings 2 this feature is even more powerful, giving you the same creative flexibility over the multi patches as well! This is the quickest and easiest way to sound like your favorite classic records.
