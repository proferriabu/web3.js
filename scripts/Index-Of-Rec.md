The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The HDI uses the logarithm of income, to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing GNI. The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean. Refer to Technical notes for more details.
 
The HDI can be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.
 
The HDI simplifies and captures only part of what human development entails. It does not reflect on inequalities, poverty, human security, empowerment, etc. The HDRO provides other composite indices as broader proxy on some of the key issues of human development, inequality, gender disparity and poverty.

This month, high-performance language Rust jumped from position #17 to position #13 in the TIOBE index. This is an all time high for Rust. Gaining 4 positions might seem a small change, but Rust has been "the talk of the town" the last couple of years without making much progress in the TIOBE index. Rust is finally moving up. After the tailwind of the US government, which recently announced to recommend moving from C/C++ to Rust for security reasons, things are going fast for Rust. The community is growing, including the number of third party libraries and tools. In short, Rust is preparing itself for a top 10 position in the TIOBE index. --*Paul Jansen CEO TIOBE Software*
 
The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sitesGoogle, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings.It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the *best* programming language or the languagein which *most lines of code* have been written.
 
The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.
 
The complete top 50 of programming languages is listed below. This overview is published unofficially, because it could be the case that we missed a language. Ifyou have the impression there is a programming language lacking, please notify us at tpci@tiobe.com. Please also check the overview of all programming languages that we monitor.
 
We spent a lot of effort to obtain all the data and keep the TIOBE index up to date. In order to compensate a bit for this, we ask a fee of 5,000 US$ for the complete data set. The data set runs from June 2001 till today. It started with 25 languages back in 2001, and now measures more than 150 languages once a month. The data are available in comma separated format. Please contact sales@tiobe.com for more information.
 
The K-index, and by extension the Planetary K-index, are used to characterize the magnitude of geomagnetic storms. Kp is an excellent indicator of disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field and is used by SWPC to decide whether geomagnetic alerts and warnings need to be issued for users who are affected by these disturbances.
 
The principal users affected by geomagnetic storms are the electrical power grid, spacecraft operations, users of radio signals that reflect off of or pass through the ionosphere, and observers of the aurora.
 
This chart updates every minute. The Estimated 3-hour Planetary Kp-index is derived at the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center using data from the following ground-based magnetometers: Sitka, Alaska; Meanook, Canada; Ottawa, Canada; Fredericksburg, Virginia; Hartland, UK; Wingst, Germany; Niemegk, Germany; and Canberra, Australia. These data are made available thanks to the cooperative efforts between SWPC and data providers around the world, which currently includes the U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN), the British Geological Survey, the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), and Geoscience Australia. Important magnetometer observations are also contributed by the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and the Korean Space Weather Center K-index Watches are issued when the highest predicted NOAA estimated Kp-indices for a day are K = 5, 6, 7, or >= 8 and is reported in terms of the NOAA G scale. K-index Warnings are issued when NOAA estimated Kp-indices of 4, 5, 6, and 7 or greater are expected. K-index Alerts are issued when the NOAA estimated Kp-indices reach 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
 
The K-index quantifies disturbances in the horizontal component of earth's magnetic field with an integer in the range 0-9 with 1 being calm and 5 or more indicating a geomagnetic storm. It is derived from the maximum fluctuations of horizontal components observed on a magnetometer during a three-hour interval. The planetary 3-hour-range index Kp is the mean standardized K-index from 13 geomagnetic observatories between 44 degrees and 60 degrees northern or southern geomagnetic latitude. The label 'K' comes from the German word 'Kennziffer' meaning 'characteristic digit.' The K-index was introduced by Julius Bartels in 1938. SWPC has used the K-index since the forecast center began operations.
 
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across portions of the central/northern Plains Sunday while heavy to excessive rainfall may bring flooding to northern Minnesota and the Tennessee Valley. Dry and windy conditions will bring elevated to critical fire weather across parts of the Great Basin while dry thunderstorms may lead to new wildfire starts in the northern Rockies. Read More >
 
It surprises many people to learn that the heat index values in the chart above are for shady locations. If you are exposed to direct sunlight, the heat index value can be increased by up to 15F. As shown in the table below, heat indices meeting or exceeding 103F can lead to dangerous heat disorders with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity in the heat.
 
An index fund is a mutual fund or ETF that seeks to replicate the performance of an index, often by constructing its portfolio to mirror that of the index itself. Index investing is considered a passive strategy since it does not involve any stock picking or active management. Studies show that over time, indexing strategies tend to perform better than stock picking strategies. Because they are passive index funds also tend to have lower fees and tax exposure.
 
Indexes are useful for providing valid benchmarks against which to measure investment performance for a given strategy or portfolio. By understanding how a strategy does relative to a benchmark, one can understand its true performance.
 
Indexes also provide investors with a simplified snapshot of a large market sector, without having to examine every single asset in that index. For example, it would be impractical for an ordinary investor to study hundreds of different stock prices in order to understand the changing fortunes of different technology companies. A sector-specific index can show the average trend for the sector.
 
In the United States, the three leading stock indexes are the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite, and the Russell 2000. For international markets, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 (FTSE 100) Index and the Nikkei 225 Index are popular proxies for the British and Japanese stock markets, respectively. Most countries with stock exchanges publish at least one index for their major stocks.
 
While stock market indexes may most often come to mind, indexes are also constructed around other asset classes. In the bond market, for example, the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index tracks the investment grade bond market, while the Emerging Market Bond Index looks at government bonds of emerging market economies.
 
The **z-index** CSS property sets the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or flex and grid items. Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.
 
This is the stack level of the generated box in the current stacking context. The box also establishes a local stacking context. This means that the z-indexes of descendants are not compared to the z-indexes of elements outside this element.
 
As a proven predictor of financial performance, organizations from a wide range of diverse industries leverage the ACSI methodology to obtain science-based insights across the complete arc of the customer experience.
 
As the only national cross-industry measure of customer satisfaction available in the United States, the American Customer Satisfaction Index is a strategic resource for business, investment, and government communities alike.
