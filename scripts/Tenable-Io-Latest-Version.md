The Tenable Vulnerability Management API enables you to programmatically manage assets, scans, and policies from the cloud. The endpoints provide actionable insight into your entire infrastructure's security risks, allowing you to quickly and accurately identify, investigate, and prioritize vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in your modern IT environment.
 
The Tenable Web App Scanning API endpoints enable you to automate the security management for your web applications. You can safely and accurately scan web applications, providing deep visibility into vulnerabilities and context for prioritizing remediations.
 
The Tenable Identity Exposure API enables you to secure your infrastructure by anticipating threats, detecting breaches, and responding to incidents and attacks. You can programmatically monitor indicators of attack and indicators of exposure to allow you to discover underlying issues affecting your Active Directory, identify dangerous trust relationships, and analyze in-depth details of attacks.

Tenable's PCI ASV streamlines the quarterly external vulnerability scan submission and dispute process as required by PCI. You can use the PCI ASV API to retrieve a list of PCI ASV attestations, disputes, and scans.
 
The Tenable Cloud Security API enables you to programmatically scan multi-cloud instances and the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) used to provision the environments. The Cloud Security endpoints can be used to onboard cloud accounts, manage projects and repositories, and retrieve scan results.
 
Tenable Attack Surface Management enables you to identify internet-accessible assets that may or may not be known to your organization. Attack Surface Management identifies assets using DNS records, IP addresses, and ASN, and includes more than 180 columns of metadata to help you organize and inventory your assets.
 
The Tenable Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) Portal API provides a secure and accessible way for MSSP administrators to manage and maintain multiple customer instances of Tenable products. Endpoints in the Tenable MSSP Portal API allow you to view and manage your MSSP customer accounts.
 
The Downloads API enables you to access and download installation and update files for available Tenable products. You can use the API endpoints to list product pages, list downloads available for a specific product, and to download a file. The endpoints can also be used to determine and download the latest version of a file to facilitate the automation of an installation.
 
First off, I'm surprised no-one has mentioned this yet, but the main issue with the EA you posted, is that it's not an EA. Extension Attributes only work if some string or result of a command is output (usually echoed) between  and  tags. Otherwise the EA for your Macs will remain blank in your console forever.
 
But outside of that, if you still need some help in getting a working EA together, I'll post the old ones I used to use as well. We no longer use Nessus where I am, but when we did, this was the Extension Attribute I had for the version:
 
I also had this EA for capturing its status, as in Installed (Running + Connected etc.) or what the status was. I have no idea if this even works anymore with the current Nessus agent version, but you can try it in case it interests you.
 
Hey everyone. I tried several/all of these solutions above and I am not having much luck. Either I am not getting hardly any version information or more importantly my results are coming back that the tenable agent is installed on all of my fleet which is not true. Any ideas of what is happening?

pyTenable is intended to be a pythonic interface into the Tenable applicationAPIs. Further by providing a common interface and a common structure betweenall of the various applications, we can ease the transition from the vastlydifferent APIs between some of the products.
 
pyTenable version 1.2 is the first release to drop support for Pythonversions less than 3.7. If you are still using any of these deprecatedpython versions the 1.1 release will still work, however is no longer beingactively developed or maintained.
 
When having an issue with a Windows Office 365 app causing conflict issues with the installed version of Office 365 I was told that the apps are per profile & if you wanted to make a change it would be done per profile, or alternatively on an image before setup. I could be wrong about your specific case but that was what I had found out about my particular issue. Hope that helps. Have a great day!
