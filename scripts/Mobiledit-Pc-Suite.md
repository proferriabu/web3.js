**Kill all other applications that may be using USB or Bluetooth ports.**Some PC suites run in the background of your system. We recommend using task manager to close running processes so that they do not interfere with the connection between your phone and MOBILedit.
 
**Try another connection type**Some phones cannot be connected via cable (although being the preferred method), but connection via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi is supported (and vice versa). Find your phone in the list of supported phones to determine if this is the case.
 
**Try to pair your phone using Windows Bluetooth Wizard (Bluetooth only)**After you have already established a Bluetooth connection in Windows and paired the devices, simply run MOBILedit and the phone will be found immediately. If you are unable to pair your phone with Windows, then you should contact your computer administrator for help.
 
**Try MOBILedit with your phone on another computer**Some combinations of computer software installed on a PC may block communication between a phone and MOBILedit This step will determine if this is the case.

The Competitive Upgrade policy makes it possible to obtain Elcomsoft Premium Forensic Bundle as an upgrade of a competitive password recovery suite (contact us for detailed information).
 
ElcomSoft pioneered many software innovations that have made it easier to break a wide range of passwords. We were the first to refactor 56-bit encryption in Microsoft Office products. We patented GPU-accelerated password recovery, revolutionizing the speed of password recovery without requiring expensive hardware. We were the first to extract iOS backups from Apple iCloud, and the first to mix AMD and NVIDIA video cards for even faster attacks.
 
Elcomsoft Premium Forensic Bundle allows corporate customers, IT support administrators, forensic and law enforcement officials to gain access to various password-protected documents. The password recovery suite features the latest and most advanced cryptanalysis algorithms developed by ElcomSoft Research department. The mobile forensic tools included in the pack enable access to critical evidence stored in physical devices, local backups and cloud services. We continue to deliver cutting-edge technologies in password recovery, mobile and cloud forensics.
 
Elcomsoft Premium Forensic Bundle is capable of instantly recovering passwords for a wide range of business and office applications, text processors, spreadsheets, database management programs, office suites, email clients, instant messengers, etc. Over a hundred different file formats and types of password encryption methods can be recovered instantly.
 
**Break passwords to more than 500 types of data**
Our password recovery tools support documents created by most popular Office suites from the oldest to the latest versions. We support all popular crypto containers, encrypted compressed archives, system disk and file system encryption, and many other types of passwords. Our tools exploit every known vulnerability to unlock documents instantly or near instantly, while employing smart attacks and high-end hardware acceleration techniques to quickly recover strong passwords.
 
**Heterogeneous GPU acceleration with multiple different video cards per computer**
Today's PC motherboards support multiple video cards. Thanks to ElcomSoft's proprietary heterogeneous computing, our tools support a mix of up to 32 video cards even if they are of different makes and models, allowing for even faster password recovery applications for a modest increase in hardware costs. The tool allows mixing NVIDIA and AMD boards of different generations in a single PC.
 
**20 to 250 times faster attacks with hardware acceleration**
Our tools utilize dedicated high-performance cores found in today's video cards such as those manufactured by NVIDIA and AMD to offload parts of computational-intensive calculations onto the highly scalable video cards. Featuring several hundred GPU cores, a single video card can deliver the speed far exceeding the metrics of a high-end CPU. Our thoroughly optimized algorithms enable reaching recovery rates that are up to 250 times faster compared to CPU-only benchmarks.
 
**Linear scalability on up to 10,000 computers**
ElcomSoft password recovery tools have zero overhead. By doubling the number of PCs working on a password, you cut the time required to recover a password by half. By only transferring the bare minimum of information over the network, our tools enable massively parallel operation, and scale linearly to as many as 10,000 workstations and cloud instances with no scalability
