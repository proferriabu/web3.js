To facilitate the verification, Appdome has created a simple verification app to validate F5 Big IP Mobile Anti Bot configuration. This app, which is **manually integrated** with the F5 Anti Bot SDK, diagnoses your Anti Bot policy on your F5 BIG-IP and indicates if your F5 Anti Bot SDK will be able to initialize successfully. In addition, when connecting to the protected hosts, the app still displays the HTTP responses before/ after the SDK initialization.
 
Before using the F5 Anti Bot verification app, you are strongly recommended to check that your protected resource is accessible from your network. You can try to access the resource through either your computer-based or your mobile-based browser.

If your server is accessible, your Anti Bot is set up and configured correctly, and you entered the correct data in the app, the initialization of the SDK should succeed and you will receive a verification PIN. Enter this verification PIN on our platform and proceed to build your app with F5 AntiBot SDK.
 
If the Anti Bot SDK is initialized successfully, and your URL is in the list of subdomains, the app will engage the Anti Bot SDK cookies for the request. In this case, you will successfully reach your protected host. You can view the connection details by clicking on **See Details** at the bottom of the screen.
 
If the Anti Bot SDK initialization failed for the Anti Bot Verification app, which is **manually**integrated with SDK, it will also fail with your target app when built with the SDK automatically by Appdome.

The OWASP MASVS (Mobile Application Security Verification Standard) is a standard that establishes mobile app security requirements for developers to build secure mobile apps and security teams to test mobile apps. On Appdome, brands can easily comply with the OWASP MASVS standard.

reCAPTCHA is an anti-bot tool you can implement in your web app to prevent bad actors from programmatically filling out forms and spamming your endpoints. In this post, we'll implement Google's reCAPTCHA protocol using the Google reCAPTCHA 2 client-side library and our very own hand-rolled verification client.
 
CAPTCHA is a mechanism through which we can programmatically determine whether a user is a human or a bot. CAPTCHA actually stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart". A typical CAPTCHA will ask the user to submit some input that only a human (or a Cylon? That part is still a little fuzzy...) can provide. For example, typing in some blurry letters from an image, selected a set of images that contain a car or a street sign.
 
Integrating Google reCAPTCHA is pretty straightforward. First thing's first though, we need to register our app with the Google reCAPTCHA service and receive our application's site key and secret key.
 
However, we want a little more control over the appearance and behavior of our widget. For example, we want to set the theme and language of the widget. For this level of control, we'll use the explicit render approach.
 
Let's define our onload function and insert the Javascript resource. Note that when we insert the resource, we are setting the onload parameter to the name of our onload callback function, onRecaptchaElementLoad, and the render parameter to explicit. Also note that we are using the async defer flag for our script tag, to ensure that the script is not run before the rest of the page loads.

 
The sitekey param is required, and is set to the value of the site key we received when we registered our app with the Google reCAPTCHA service. I added my site key to my ENV vars with the help of the dotenv gem.
 
We'll verify our reCAPTCHA response as a before\_action in our controller. Although we are only placing the reCAPTCHA widget on our registration form right now, I absolutely anticipate using reCAPTCHA on other pages. For example, let's say a few weeks from now I find my sign in or password reset pages being spammed by a lot of bot form submission attempts. I want the ability to quickly and easily include reCAPTCHA verification to these and potentially other controllers in the future. And I want to do so without repeating code.
 
So, in anticipation of this future requirement, and with the desire to keep our code DRY always in mind, we'll put our reCAPTCHA verification code in a controller module that we'll include in the RegistrationsController.
 
We'll define our module in app/controllers/concerns. It will call a before action which will in turn call on our very own reCAPTCHA verification service (coming soon!). It will redirect if the verification failed. It will leverage ActiveSupport::Concern to get access to some nice clean included; do syntax.

 
Let's think about this responsibility for a moment. In order for our verifier service to carry this responsibility, does it need to know about the reCAPTCHA mechanism, i.e. that we are using Google reCAPTCHA? No!
 
Our service will use dependency injection to call on a recaptcha\_client. That client will be responsible to enacting the reCAPTCHA verification via an external API, in our case the Google reCAPTCHA API.

 
Here, we're passing in the reCAPTCHA response from the params, the IP address (this is a param that the Google reCAPTCHA API requires, and we'll take a look at that API soon), and a third, optional argument of the reCAPTCHA client. We default that client to the GoogleRecaptcha, a class that we will define next to handle the actual Google reCAPTCHA API request.
 
Our Google reCAPTCHA client will act as the actual verification mechanism in our reCAPTCHA flow. As such, it has one job: send the verification request to the Google reCAPTCHA API and parse the response.
 
Our client expects to receive an argument of a hash containing the Google reCAPTCHA API's required params of remoteip (pointing to the IP of the original user's request) and response (pointing to the response that came through from the "g-recaptcha" param of the original request).
 
Different markets and industries, including e-commerce, social media, fintech, airline and travel, and online ticket services, are losing billions of dollars each year because of fake web traffic generated by illicit scrapers, fake accounts, robot buyers, carders, and stuffers. According to a 2017 report, bots are so pervasive that they are responsible for 52% of all online traffic.
 
CAPTCHA services and IP reputation feeds are used to counter the abuse of bots and scripts, which can facilitate e-commerce fraud and account takeover. However, abusers and cybercriminals are using residential proxies and CAPTCHA-solving services to circumvent these security measures. Residential proxies, which can hide originating IP addresses, can be used for a plethora of fraudulent activities, including gift card, chargeback, and click fraud.
 
This article provides insights on how abusers and cybercriminals use residential proxies and CAPTCHA-solving services to enable bots, scrapers, and stuffers. We also provide in-depth technical analyses of popular residential proxies and CAPTCHA-defeating services, and propose ways to detect and defeat them.
 
Despite their prevalence, account takeover bots are not the only problem. Price and inventory scrapers can also cause unnecessary financial upheaval among vendors. Robot buyers, such as sneaker bots and scalper bots, deprive real buyers of the opportunity to buy discounted or limited-edition items, which can result in a negative buying experience.
 
Sneaker bots have become a big enough problem that Nike added antibot regulations to its terms of sale agreement, which allow for the cancellation of orders or the limiting of purchase quantities if it is determined that the sale was made using automation. Scalper bots, on the other hand, are being used to secure tickets and services that have a great public demand. Last year, Akamai reported that scalper bots are being used to take all available appointment slots from the Israeli government services via the MyVisit platform. The operators of these scalper bots sold each appointment slot for more than US$100.
 
However, malicious actors and abusers have developed tools to counter these defensive measures. Residential proxy services can be used to bypass IP reputation services, and such bypassing techniques are under regular review by the scraping community. When a CAPTCHA challenge appears, CAPTCHA-solving services can be used to defeat the verification. We discussed three interesting residential proxy and CAPTCHA-solving service cases in a recently published blog entry.
 
Proxyway, a blog site dedicated to all things proxyware, provides insights on targeted sectors and big brand names, such as AliExpress, Amazon, Craigslist, Home Depot, Walmart, Booking.com, Indeed, Bing, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Instagram. Meanwhile, other proxy sellers, such as proxy-sale.com, directly offer proxies that are packaged according to their specific use cases, as seen in Figure 1.
 
In the following sections, we will give examples of scrapers, robot buyers, carders and stuffers, and account takeover attacks that use residential proxies and CAPTCHA-solving services in their operations.
 
Web scrapers are automated tools that are designed to collect or scrape information in bulk from targeted websites. These tools are often created in a way that can pass as human users and use anti-CAPTCHA services and residential proxies to bypass IP addresses. In 2018, web scrapers reportedly caused e-commerce websites an estimated 2% loss in online revenue.
