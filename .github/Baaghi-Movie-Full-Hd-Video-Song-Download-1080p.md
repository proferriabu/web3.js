The music for this captivating track Jigra 2 has been given by Western Pendu, with heartfelt lyrics penned by Baaghi. The music video for Jigra 2 has been skillfully directed by Tore Sherry.

Now the original lyricist of the song, Charanjit Singh Maakar (also known as Channi Khannewala) has reportedly sued the makers of Baaghi 2 for copyright infringement with charges of plagiarism and alteration of lyrics,reportsMumbai Mirror.
 
Maakar even tried reaching out to the producer of Baaghi 2 Sajid Nadiadwala who completely ignored him. Leaving no choice, Maakar sent a legal notice to director Ahmed Khan, music label T-Series, lyricist Ginni Diwan, music director Sandeep Shirodkar, playback singers Navraj Hans and Palak Muchhal and Tiger Shroff, reports Mirror. He also approached the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) chief Prasoon Joshi and the Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd regarding the issue.
 
Maakar also said that in the 2003 film, Boom, a remixed version of the song was used similarly without seeking any permission. After Janjua and he challenged the makers of the film in court, the song had to be removed from the film. However, later when American rapper Jay-Z approached them for a remix, they agreed and are still getting royalty for the revamped track. The song was used as part of the OST of the 2012 Sacha Baron Cohen starrer The Dictator.
 
Actor Disha Patani will soon be seen dancing to the beats of a dance number from Baaghi 3 called Do You Love Me. A teaser of the song released by the makers, Nadiadwala Grandson, informs that their song is a licensed version of the original by Rene Bendali.

The singer posted on Instagram to share the Indian song which has a strikingly similar music composition to that of 'Baaghi's'. "Indian Music directors Yasser Desai and Rashid Khan copied my original song 'Baaghi' and I am not proud of it. Absolutely not!" he wrote in the caption.
 
'Piya Re Piya' has been sung by Desai and was released on YouTube on February 12. In the video's description, the song's composition has been credited to Khan, the lyrics have been credited to Khan and Anjan Sagri and the song's production to Aditya Dev.
 
Shuja told Images that he is certain 'Baaghi' has been plagiarised. "They've definitely copied the song," he said. "They've copied the entire verse. I'm going to look into how to pursue this further because these people have started copying [Pakistani content] a lot. They not only copy melodies, they copy lyrics as well. Look at Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's work. They've gone too far; they are copying our content whenever they please and there's no one to say anything to them. I definitely feel something should be done about this.
 
"I am going to talk to my lawyer. I am going to talk to people who can help me with this. I don't think I should take it lightly. If you look at the credits, the composer of the song is written as Rashid Khan. This is a criminal act. They don't even give due credit. If you'd framed the song as a cover and given credit, it would still be okay."
 
This isn't the first accusation of plagiarism against an Indian music content in recent times. In 2021, director Nabeel Qureshi accused Indian Punjabi song 'Mood Happy' of ripping off his music video for 'Ki Jana' sung by Shani Arshad. In 2019, singer Farhan Saeed slammed Bollywood composer Salim Merchant for plagiarising his song 'Roiyaan'.
