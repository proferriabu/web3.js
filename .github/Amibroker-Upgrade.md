I am using the 6.1 as RT automated trading platform. May I know if I could just install the 6.3 over the 6.1 and all the settings will be kept as 6.1? Also, Can I keep both versions in the same computer that in case if I face any problem with 6.3 then I can just switch back to 6.1 immediately and fix the problem later?
 
If you run setup program on computer that has previous version installed, AmiBroker setup program will perform in-place upgrade. **All settings, formulas and databases will be kept without changes.**
 
It is worth nothing that you can also downgrade the same way - just run setup program for previous version and it will perform in-place downgrade without touching your settings, formulas and databases.
 
Side-by-side installations of different versions is possible, but not recommended because they would need to use different paths and you would need to "manually" keep track which path you use for what.
 
Thanks Tomasz. I already upgraded and I got one problem : In my RT trading I use sendmail function to send me email on every 5 min. The way I used is to apply the AFL on the chart, and then set the interval at 5min. I use esignal as my data source. So when every 5 min, when there is a new bar coming in, it would trigger the alert function and send me an email.
 
After I upgraded, I found that it is no longer able to be triggered. I go into the preference and try the email text function, the email can be sent. So the setting is ok(in fact, after upgrade all the setting are same, just like you advised).
 
There is absolutely no difference in SendMail function in 6.30. It wasn't touched. But if you are using eSignal it may be the eSignal plugin version. See my response here:
 Watchlist with CAM Indicator AFL Programming Since eSignal itself uses older version of C runtime (2005) it probably has some incompatibility with VC 2017. Therefore please replace eSignal.dll inside "Plugins" subdirectory with the file from 6.27.1 version (compiled with VC2005) available here: \_6271\_x64/eSignal.dll (or zipped) \_6271\_x64/eSignal.zip It should address the problem.
 
Currently im using Amibroker Ver 6.30.5 and do not have any problem. But after seeing this topic i am interested to upgrade to ver. 6.40.4 as there are a lot of improvement in terms of simplicity and speed also.
 
After I upgraded from 6.38 to 6.40.2, the Ticker Box is empty (see screenshot). I performed an "Upgrade" installation where AmiBroker is installed under the default "C:\Program Files\AmiBroker" directory. I have rebooted the PC and tried the upgrade installation 3 times, but to no avail. Windows 10 21H2.
 
In my setup with 4k display i recognize "Ticker Combobox" is shrinking the Symbollist, "Interval Combobox" does not. AB v6.39.1 and v6.40.0 does not have this behavior with 4k display, "Ticker Combobox" is working correct...
 
So much happy to confirm that "Reset Ticker Bar, close and re-open Amibroker" did work for me also - (It is mid-night here - right now) - but could not wait to test the solution and then confirm it here.
 
I have done some more testing and it seems only to occur when symbol combo box in ticker bar was CUSTOMIZED (resized) using previous versions. The UI library then attempts to load "old" customized toolbar. RESETTING Ticker toolbar as previously explained fully fixes this issue as it removes old customization "leftovers" from that bar.
